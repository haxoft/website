                          Another week - another 7 days without a customer meeting.
                          Originally, we we expected to see Prof. Gaedke on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he did not have time for a meeting.
                          It is quite hard to make significant progress in a project without showing it to somebody who is not directly involved in it. We
                          have been missing a more frequent input from an "external viewer" along the development.
                          As we also experienced, it is motivating to know that the customer is interested in our product and being able to
                          discuss some details with him is crucial to keep the right direction during development.
                          Having that in mind, weekly meetings would be a nice thing to have.
                          This way, we would be able to have more frequent feedback on how we performed/are performing and the adjustments we should make.
                          We are however still doing our best to deal with the current conditions and situation. After all, adjusting to
                          unexpected situations is a key skill of any development team.
                          It is worth mentioning that we very much appreciate the possibility to be consulting issues regarding our emerging product
                          with our prof., as his planspiel role is twofold: our counselor and the first customer at the same time.
                          <br/>
                          After the original Wednesday meeting, which did not take place, we received information from the prof. that the next
                          customer meeting should be on Tuesday next week. We are looking forward to it!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regardless of whether the meeting took place or not, we continued with the development of the HXT and the corresponding tasks.
                          Having in mind the fact that the planspiel is coming to its end, we started to sketch out our business plan.
                          Our business model served as a good foundation for this purpose. Within this week, we made some notes about different
                          thoughts we collected and drafted the concrete sections. In order to have a first draft of our business plan, we will have to
                          do some more research and continue with the task during the next week.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As we already mentioned, the development of the project still continues. We managed to add user management
                          to the backend and the frontend of the application, as well as the corresponding session management. This functionality
                          allows the HXT to recognize different users (with different access rights) and to serve resources to these users accordingly.
                          One part of this functionality that was especially time consuming was the authentication of users (user agents) making requests
                          to the HXT plugin. The user management is handled at the "front-line" by <a href="https://de.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>
                          and our plugin just simply receives a "claim" containing the information about the user making the request. This kind of delegated
                          authentication was a bit confusing at the beginning, since it comprises 3 entities (Atlassian, HXT, User agent)
                          sending and receiving a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>.
                          <br/>
                          To close this entry with some good news, we are happy to announce that we are now very close to the first
                          automated extraction of some important proposal requirements! We have found the first two
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> (which are
                          both very big and ugly creatures) and we are currently trying to insert them in the extraction module of the HXT plugin.

                      <p>
                          We did it! Our weekly log is now fully filled until now and so everyone can now read our whole weekly log at our website.
                          So we wrote this week the last entires that were missing in fulltext. And uploaded now also all the entires to our homepage.
                          From now on, we will continue to write every week a new entry to our diary here.
                          And so every interest can see what is going on right now behind the scenes.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To come also to some more important stuff we did this week, we should start with the fact, that again this week,
                          was no meeting with Prof. Gaedke, but of course the team itself met as every week.
                          Within this meeting we decided that we will focus this week on the first idea we mentioned already last week.
                          So we started to implement our IR idea for the core section of HXT.
                          One more thing to have a web application was the direct sharing between users.
                          Well, until now there is no sharing of the users with Atlassian, so we need also to connect our system with the Atlassian user management.
                          To have the sharing of requirements for a given call for proposals also included in our MVP, we started the connection to the user management of Atlassian this week.
                          While we finished, as mentioned in the beginning of this log, our log itself this week, we also continued our CANVAS model.
                          Because at first we presented two weeks ago our first image of the CANVAS to Prof. Gaedke.
                          He was there also not amused that we did not clearly show him prizes within the costs seciton of the CANVAS.
                          We did some assuming there but in our first CANVAS this section was not filled with that much details.
                          So we continued also there to have now a fully filled CANVAS model with also some real numbers for the costs.
                          With those we can now also show our CANVAS to potential investors to show them, how we want to earn money, while having of course some monthly costs for
                          ourselves, the server or rather our infrastructure and for the tools we need to develop.
                          Right now the tools for developing do not cost anything, because we are still students and thereby have licences for our preferred IDE's.
                          But after our studies and the end of the current planspiel we will have some costs there due to the fact that we are then not anymore students.

                      <p>
                          Due to the lack of a meeting this week we simply continued our work of last week.
                          Hence we did some more research and wrote some more entries to our weekly log in text form.
                          It is quite time consuming to write all those logs in the future.
                          Of course the bullet list of our logs help to write the logs in full text form, nevertheless it is always some formulating stuff.
                          So you need to build a nice readable structure for the week and formulate everything.
                          Maybe it would not be that effort to write them directly after each week, but until this week we did not do that.
                          We just listed it via keywords. So somehow we learned that writing a diary is often easier to write if you write
                          the text form quite close to the happenings.
                          However the count of entries in our weekly log rised a lot this week.
                          But still we have to continue here in the next week to get a fully filled weekly log from the beginning until the present.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          It reveals that also the research is now coming to some great ideas for our core section of requirement extraction.
                          We connected some ideas and now we have more or less two ideas, which we could start to use for our magic.
                          Therefore we also started to integrate some more libraries in our server and started to gather some details about the requirments to extract.
                          Because the idea we are starting with is a bit more closer to the IR dimension. So also queries will play their role in it.
                          Therefore we began this week to built some queries for the most common requirements we think our users will have.
                          Unless that we could there also be wrong we also asked one of our potential customers and early adopters of the VSR,
                          if we can see one of his requirement summaries for a proposal writing. Just to be not totally lifted within our assumptions of
                          relevant requirements for our users. Until the end of the week we do not have a look into one summary yet, but we will have one next week.
                          <br/>
                          The second idea is a bit more closer to IE and is therefore maybe a bit more complex to build.
                          For us it is clear that we want to bring in both ideas to HXT, but to have a running MVP at the end of the semester
                          it is not clear until now, the 5th February '17, if we will have them both integrated in our first MVP.
                          Because both of them cover our core section and both of them can also standalone to fulfill our users' needs.
                          To have an even better solution in the end it seems to be better to have them both.
                          But maybe if we start with one idea this assumption could exhibit to be wrong.
                          Still we continued also at our second idea to have it a bit more clear in detail, what we need to do there to develop it.

                          Unfortunately our start of the week was not that good. We met again at Monday, as the last weeks,
                          with Prof. Gaedke, but he was not happy about our increment. Moreover he was more like a bit pissed.
                          Well, somehow we can say, yes, there was not that high increment than some other weeks before.
                          But we still do not really understand why an increment is only an increment if there is that much new to see.
                          Because he claimed out that we did not do much more visible functionality at the HXT. And yes we did not do that.
                          We focused last week there on the API and so for monday this increment in the HXT was not visible to a user.
                          However we of course did some other stuff. Like many research, the homepage and of course the canvas.
                          But still Prof. Gaedke said, it is no increment if it is not visible. So we should have every week somehow a visible increment in our software.
                          Even if we do not really understand him fully to the fact we did not have an increment, we can understand him, that he wants to have
                          every week a visible increment. In the end we learned from meeting, that we should be able to show him new stuff at HXT every week.
                          That seems to be possible and we now aim on it.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          So this week we need again more focus on our research in our magic section. Until now only Valentin had made the research, but to
                          go on with our philosophy that in major decisions everyone should be happy, everyone needs some knowledge about our core feature.
                          Hence also Frank and Luis started this week with their knowledge acquisition. Furthermore we need to have a clue how we really want
                          to proceed in our core or magic section of HXT.
                          Until now Valentin had several ideas, but without knowledge about NLP it is hard to understand strategies about it.
                          So we decided that really everyone needs some knowledge there.
                          Moreover this knowledge of everyone will help us to generate even more and maybe also better ideas due to different researches.
                          <br/>
                          Additionally we wanted to have a increment in our HXT at the beginning of the new week, so we continued with our connection building within our infrastructure.
                          Thereby we developed the connection between our server and the user interface.
                          Therefore we decided on a restful CRUD API with JSON data. So that the user interface or rather our html views can easily adopt the data delivered by our server.
                          Of course also the views themselves are deliver by the server, but they are not saved in our database and so not the data we are working on.
                          They are only as the name terms the views for the user to make the data visible.
                          <br/>
                          As we did included a description section about HXT on our page, we also talked about a weekly log via the button "see what's going on".
                          Of course right now you are reading our weekly log, but to the end of this week we first designed the weekly log section accordingly to our homepage.
                          Moreover we wrote the first entry of the full log in text form. Because until then we only had a word document where we pinned our log with keywords
                          in a bullet list.

                          The meeting with Professor Gaedke this week was not that spectacular, we summarized and presented the work of the last week to him.
                          Beyond we told him, how we want to proceed. Of course he had not nothing to say, but the meeting was the first time quite short and
                          also very satisfactorily for us.
                          <br/>
                          What he mentioned was that we should include somehow a description section of HXT in our page.
                          And some special section for him to see what is going on in our team.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          So we updated our website accordingly. Therefore we sketched at first a short styling idea and then worked out our core sentences to capture potential users' interest.
                          Underneath this short introduction of HXT and where it helps proposal writers, we added two buttons.
                          One for accessing our electronic prototype of the HXT and another for our weekly log.
                          So everyone can read what is going on in our team. Even if like this week the entry of the log is bit shorter.
                          What we also did this week is developing the understanding of our backend at our server.
                          Thus we wrote code for our database model in django to give the server the understanding.
                          So we somehow connected the backend with our server, which is currently only running as a test instance locally on each computer, where we develop.
                          <br/>
                          While we continued parts of our research on NLP, we experienced that we can somehow separate our the whole topic more deeply in our context in two parts.
                          On the one hand side there is Information Retrieval (IR), which is common known for searching documents or information via any interface.
                          So for example every search machine as Google, DuckDuckGo or even Yahoo, whics more directly a pah is not even more acessible via this name, uses IR to fulfill its users' needs.
                          On the other side is Information Extraction (IE), which irt of extracting knowledge with highend semantic structured AIs.
                          Somehow both parts can be very interesting for us, even if IR is of course not that direct connected to NLP as IE.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As a last point we draw our first CANVAS model with <a href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/">leanstack.com</a>.
                          Another interesting experience. Of course all the stuff we wrote was already in our mind, but necessarily we have to write it down.
                          Thereby the whole imagination of ourselves changes of course and this is the point where it gets interesting.
                          To save some time and to bring in as much ideas as possible, everyone of us draw at first his own CANVAS model for Haxoft.
                          Afterwards we connected our CANVAS models and merged. Thereby the core essence of our current minds came in the model
                          and everyone had some influences on the final first CANVAS of Haxoft.

                      <p>
                          This week started with a really long meeting with Professor Gaedke. Somehow we had to talk a lot.
                          Moreover we presented him the electronic prototype, our short first business plan and gave him a once-over of our research about the calls for proposals.
                          In the group we were on the way to build a desktop application. Hence our prototype is built that way.
                          But of course our study course Web Engineering should maybe not bring some non web applications as results.
                          The Professor also claimed that we should have a web application. In our mind there was no direct need in our purpose for a web application, so we
                          did not even thought much about it.
                          Anyways, Prof. Gaedke pointed out that most of the times the users want to share such requirements - and hey, why not sharing it easily direct via our app?
                          We had already our import/export feature in mind, but the direct sharing within HXT was not included. Well now it will be.
                          Thereby we will start to implement HXT as an web application. And even if the prototype seems not to be an web application due to the lack of browser feeling,
                          we still want to keep it. Because the core points are still as relevant as before and we still think such a GUI will satisfy our users.
                          Moreover Prof. Gaedke brought us to the point of including our web application directly in another web application.
                          So for example, he said, we could develop our app on top of Atlassian or maybe on top of Wordpress or even on top of Google.
                          With such an ontop realization, we can exclude some basic stuff as real user management or basic web security issues.
                          Moreover we can directly access the users from the given platform by providing them a plugin or an addon for one of their familiar interfaces.
                          Futhermore we can then hopefully answer with 'Yes!', if someone will ask us 'Does it scale?'.
                          This question was also ask by the Professor in our meeting. At first we could not directly answer the question, but now we see why this question is such important.
                          So a direct accessible potential user group which is already filled with many people, is a very good argument to answer the scale question with yes.
                          At least one argument. Of course we want to provide more than one argument in the end of the semester.
                          For now we can say, that we have a big potential user group within universities at the start point, but also thought about guys who want to work with any institute
                          of the government. Moreover also guys developing international or also national standards can be a potential user group for HXT.
                          So we already have not only first adopters and a user group behind them, but also more new potential user groups.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To go on with our work over the week, we first needed to make some short research about common platforms we could use.
                          After that we met and talked about our ideas to come to a decision on what platform we want to start our development.
                          The result of this discussion was Atlassian, because their we can provide an addon, which is based on our own webserver.
                          So we register our addon at the cloud of Atlassian and if someone wants to use it, Atlassian will call our webserver, which then will provide
                          HTMLs to the user within his Atlassian application. Moreover Atlassian provides developers of addons also a nice kit of styling sources, such that the
                          application will not inherit the user interface of Atlassian, but ensure an overarching look and feel for the user.
                          The perfect point for us is thereby that we then have still our code at our own server and have a big possibilty to provide also an addon for other platforms
                          or rather our own website. Thus the reusability of our code is very high within an addon for Atlassian.
                          As another point of our agenda from our meeting, we created a SWOT-Analysis for Haxoft with the free version of the SWOT-Analysis Tool at
                          <a href="https://www.cayenneapps.com/swot-analysis">cayenneapps.com</a>. That gave us by doing it, an interesting insight to our own company.
                          Because we had to think about the current situation we are in and have to look from the outside on our company - at least as impartial as possible.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Further we developed a first version of the user interface at atlassian until the end of the week.
                          Thereby we started to use django as the framework for our server and postgres for our database.
                          Finally we also did two more interviews with guys from the VSR and started to read a bit about the whole topic of NLP, which is bigger than expected.

                  <div class="span8 info-block" align=justify>
                      <p>
                          Even if there was again no meeting with Prof. Gaedke this week, we started to go on with our great idea of the HXT.
                          Therefore we built our electronic prototype of HXT out of our paper prototype, which you can
                          <a href="HaxoftExtractionTool.pdf">check out</a> at your own at our website.
                          Furthermore we interviewed a Professor of our University at Wednesday.
                          At first he was not really proud of our idea and suggested that nobody will need something like plan.
                          So were really disappointed. Is there maybe noone who would buy our stuff?
                          But by going on with the interview and rather the description of our tool it tourned out that the idea is not such bad.
                          For quite the opposite the tool could really help everyone who deals with the situation to write a proposal as we thought.
                          So the first rejection was only based on not knowing the core of our idea.
                          Thus our mood rised to a high level of happiness at the end of the interview, cause once more our idea met interest.
                          Moreover we also shall write him a mail, when we pitching our idea at the end of the semester.
                          This gave us also a big charge of motivation.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To get even more results from potential customers we created a google form as a replacement of the direct interviews.
                          Such a form can be spread via social media to all potential customers and make it possible for them to give us more information without further time management of our side.
                          Hence we can get in touch with even more potential customers and their ideas and problems in the dimension of writing proposals.
                          Therefore we discussed this week a bit, how we should spread our form in detail.
                          Our first assumption is now that we will spread it via LinkedIn and E-Mail.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          In addition we made this week some research about the source of requirements - the calls for proposals.
                          So we all read finally some calls and started to get a knowledge what the given structure is all about.
                          Thereby we recognized that the European Commission is the most structured founding agency in relation to the calls.
                          I.e. the DFG is much more untidier in the structure of their calls than the EC.
                          To start anywhere we also decided to concentrate our MVP on the calls from the EC.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Last but not least, we sat together and built our first short business plan.
                          It is based on the 10/10/10 business plan idea from Alex Glassey at <a href="http://alexglassey.com/2016/12/business-planning-season-ugh/">AlexGlassey.com</a>.
                          This process showed us, that there are still many questions opened related to our business model, but we also experienced again a high team connectivity within the process.
                          There were several discussions about formulating it corretly for everyone of us, but finally we developed our first bullet listed business plan.

                          The meeting on wednesday the 14th December was the last meeting as a class of teams with the Prof. Gaedke.
                          Incredible that we are already here at the kick-off for the implementation of our ideas.
                          We were once not happy about the long not knowing about what we really do here as a solution. But somehow this meeting was a high step forward.
                          And we recognized, that we did not much the week before.
                          Ok, we also had no clue where we should really go ahead, because we still had several good ideas.
                          And we did not really made a decision on what idea we want to focus.
                          But then suddenly we had to.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Because the Professor wanted to meet us two days after the wednesday meeting. And he wants to meet each team separately.
                          Within this meeting, we should present him our idea for the planspiel - or rather our product.
                          So we had again several discussion via slack, which idea we should choose.
                          In the end, we came to our <B>H</B>axoft e<B>X</B>traction <B>T</B>ool (HXT).
                          Which was at the start of the meeting at Friday the 16th very briefly prototyped.
                          We already had many ideas, how we want to evolve and develop HXT, but we had not really sketched them into a prototype or a demo mockup.
                          In our first presentation of our ideas at the end of November, we already had a shortly drawn paper prototype for HXT, but it was one of the small ones.
                          So Prof. Gaedke was quite satisfied and contented about our idea, but also deplored that we only had on ruff sketch of our idea.
                          Hence the task for the holiday season was clear. We need really a good prototype.
                          And not only a paper prototype in the end, we want to have a clickable prototype of our idea.
                          Moreover now know, what we have to include in our report at the end of the semester.
                          Three parts are therefore important. At first our team log. Well that is what you actually read here.
                          A log or maybe diary about us as a team and how we experienced the whole planspiel.
                          As a second part we should provide a business plan and finally we also should of course have a description part about our product.
                          While the first and the last part was very clear to us all, we all have not much experience on writing a business plan.
                          Therefore we splat our high priority tasks to different people. Frank and Luis focused thereby on the prototype and Valentin focused on the business plan research.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Furthermore we also had as mentioned before two more interviews.
                          Unfortunately not all of us could come to each interview, but at every interview were at least two of us.
                          Spontaneously we also changed a bit our interview plan. Because we did not need anymore those deep details on what they are doing at project planning.
                          Additionally those topics were for us pretty clear through our first two interviews with guys from the telekom.
                          Because one company is not doing it totally different that much.
                          Of course we asked them shortly about their phases of planning, but they told us the same keywords as the other ones, hence it was as we thought.
                          What we did instead was asking them, if they would be interested in our idea - the HXT.
                          The response was not that positive, but we knew also before, that those guys do not write proposals that much.
                          Or not with such high strict requirements.
                          So it was not bad news, but confirmation of our assumptions.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          While we had our typical visits at our family by christmas and celebrated somehow the new year, we took as much time as possible to build our paper prototype
                          and get more knowledge on writing a business plan.
                          Within the end of the year we also had a paper prototype, we all agreed on.

                          With again no meeting in the week, this week does not happend that much new.
                          We of course continued to get some interviews, but the holiday season was therefore not a good friend.
                          Many people rejected us, due to pre christmas stress.
                          Actually they maybe are not interested to get interviewed by us at all, but that was mostly what they said.
                          But we had also success regarding two more interviewees from telekom for the end of the week and the beginning of next week.
                          Unfortunately we had also a little dispute about our preferred idea.
                          The good thing here is that whenever we have a little dispute, mostly everyone of us is interested in solving it
                          and not, as also one of our values demands, blame one of us. Beside of those personalities harming quite good, we also experienced our perfect team size.
                          The good thing about three guys in a team is, that mostly only two guys have much to discuss or rather argue against each other.
                          So one of us can always bring the other two back to a line of agreement by having simply a bit a distance to the discussion.
                          So even if we do not directly agree to each other, we have already our methods to go on as one team.

                      <p>Ok, yes. We somehow ended up in the last log with a sort of cliffhanger. And yes we did not explain to you all the ideas.
                          Well of course we could not, because those are our ideas and unfortunately we want to bring them up to you, if we have a more detailed view.
                          To comeback to our logging, we had to show up at our wednesday meeting of the planspiel.
                          And we had to present, what we did the last weeks. Hence we presented our results from the interviews.
                          So we sketched alignment maps for each of our interviewees, for a better visualization.
                          Moreover we presented our first paper prototypes of our corresponding ideas.
                          Well, we did not present all, but four of them.
                          Two of them a bit more detailed and the other two a bit more ruff. What means that we simply draw one very simple mockup on one piece of paper for the simpler ones.
                          Prof. Gaedke somehow demurred at our more detailed ideas, because he remembers some tools, which already supporting such issues.
                          And those are not really successfully. So we could get of course even better then they are, but we need to have it clearly in mind.
                          From our point of view, it was very interesting, that no one of our interviewees came to the point, that those tools somehow exists or he used them.
                          In the retrospective it is of course clear that by only four interviewees, such things could maybe not get mentioned.
                          But at all, we did not think about that before. So therefore we learned here again, that asking more people is always better.
                          Thus we were maybe a bit to happy about our ideas to be enough impartial.
                          Furthermore Prof. Gaedke claimed that we only interviewed four person. For us it was so much new information, that we did not really think about interviewing more in this period.
                          Besides the fact, that those interviews always need alot of preparing time due to connecting to potential interview partners and stipulating an appointment.
                          But of course interviewing more would be better. So for that Prof. Gaedke told us all, that we need at least ten interviewees.
                          So we started over to get some more interview partners.
                          By doing that we discussed alot about our ideas to form them to a newer, more detailed level of perception.
                          Furthermore we added some ideas and scraped some not good enough ones.
                          So how can we say, they are not good enough?
                          Well if no one of us sees real capability behind it with our current skill level, then it is not good enough stay in our current focus.
                          So for example we had some ideas, which were very cool but we were not sure about the feasibility by us three.
                          Some of them were so big, that we could not come to a point of having a clear idea, how we will perform and build a MVP within this semester.
                          Hence we sorted them out of our list.

                      <p>
                          This entry of our log is the first one going over two weeks. Due to some conferences and some abroad meetings of Prof. Gaedke,
                          there are no meetings until the 30th November. Within this two weeks we managed one big purpose - our interviews.
                          Hence it is not that much difference between the weeks for us, it is also not for our log.
                          So we contacted project planners we know and asked them for an interview and even asked them, if they know more guys, who would probably let us interview them.
                          <br/>
                          With some circumstances we closed the two weeks with somehow 'only' four interviews. But those interviews were all great for getting knowledge about our potential customers.
                          We interviewed so far two guys from Deutsche Telekom, further on only called telekom, and two guys from the university or rather the VSR professorship.
                          The guys from the professorship strongly talked about proposals in the context of project planning, because they need to get money from financing institutions
                          like the European Commission (EC) or the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft (DFG).
                          So they mainly focused on how they could get the money for their ideas within their scope of possibilities, where as the guys from telekom mostly do not have the decision on if they have the money or not.
                          They told us, that mostly only the vice-presidents or rather the senior-vice-presidents of the department decide whether for this idea is money bestowed or not.
                          So the ideas of on what the project is built is very different from project to project.
                          And they have also about 4 different schemes of project management and thereby different plannings.
                          They still perform sometimes a nearby waterfall-model and so a very strict planing phase.
                          The other three different types of project management within specific teams, is a bit more less planed due to agile development.
                          There are scrum teams, some mixed teams, which perform scrum without strictly roles within one team and there is the idea of kanban coming up.
                          All those more agile versions, perform less planing due to the kept opened mind of all involved to non limit the agile increment.
                          Moreover we found out that the telekom uses mostly common products, like powerpoint, or own products to help project planners.
                          This is somehow sometimes also a pain point, but it could be also be really hard to influence such a big company to perform now totally different and buy some
                          supporting software from our company. But of course we also thought about ideas how we could help those guys.
                          In the end we have about eight ideas now. And that makes us all pretty happy.

                    <div class="span8 info-block" align=justify>
                        <p>So finally we have our own issue, which we can solve. And build a solution that matters.
                            No. Wait. We do not have such an issue. There are no industrial partners working with us directly
                            in cooperation. So yeah, we are disappointed. Because somehow it would be really cool to work with
                            industrial partners from the very beginning. Unfortunately it seems to be so that no german company
                            wants to work with students and builds thereby a competitor or solution supplier for one of their main tasks.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            BUT we still can deliver a product that matters - or rather a solution that matters.
                            So if no one comes to us and presents us his problems and pain points out of his motivation to solve them,
                            we will help them and go out of the office to interview potential customers. But wait if we do not have
                            a clear idea right now what we want to build, where are our potential customers settled down?
                            Well Prof. Gaedke there somehow limited us, the teams of the current planspiel, to bring in an idea to somehow help guys, who plan projects.
                            With the knowledge of LFA and even more about some other Frameworks like HCD out of the lectures from Prof. Gaedke we have some an idea what is done by those.
                            That this could be only an idea and the reality strictly works differently was directly in our mind,
                            but we faced the challenge to find some the ideas we need to emplace our company to its 'living rights'.
                            Hence Prof. Gaedke somehow brought us a motivation to go on, but thereby strictly limited us to software for project planning.
                            And everyone of us is not that happy to develop a solution in this dimension. But still we will face it and talk to project planners.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            So to successfully hold an interview, you need some questions prepared. Therefore everyone of us brainstormed on his own and took some short notes.
                            After this short phase of orientation, we sat together and merged our ideas to a detailed plan, what we want to ask.
                            As a starting point our plan determines some easy question about our interview partner.
                            So how long she or he worked already as a project planner and what her or his current position is named.
                            With this introduction knowledge we can on one side help the interviewed one to get started in the answering flow with easy to answer questions
                            and on the other side we can later on better compare the different results from the interviews - so somehow classify them a bit.
                            Then we want to ask them which processes the apply to plan a project and if they maybe implemented standard approaches like LFA.
                            If they do not have any standard approach implemented, they should provide us with their follow up plan to come to a project plan.
                            After knowing their processes or may rather phases of creating a plan for a new project, we want to ask them detailed questions on each phase.
                            Like what are the inputs and outputs of the different phase, what they do there usually and based on which requirements they maybe need to finish this phase.
                            Moreover we want to ask them for the tools they use for project planning in each of those phases and if there are pain points anywhere.
                            Those pain points of course do not need to be only in a software, but also in other structural pursuits.
                            And maybe some phases are poorly supported?
                            <br/>
                            Furthermore we want to asked them, why they do the things the way they do it.
                            And maybe there can be different types of proposals and therefore different processes to think about.
                            In the end of the interview we want to them to grade each phase or tool with 1 to 5.
                            This will hopefully also help us to uncover pain points they even do not directly mention.

                        <p>Unfortunately and against our expectations, this weeks planspiel session didn't bring much new
                            information regarding the problem assignments. We left the session slightly disappointed
                            and with a feeling that we keep standing on the same spot, and not moving forward with the project.
                            The LFA tool was once more introduced by Prof. Gaedke, and since each one of us
                            had already read the sources, we took it as a revision of our knowledge. In the previous session,
                            all the teams were instructed to read the sources about LFA and therefore we felt that
                            the session was a bit wasted.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            However, we did receive one good message from the Prof. - he announced that problem
                            assignments should be presented during the upcoming week, probably on Monday, after the presentations
                            of our current work. The presentations were supposed to contain each team's findings regarding the LFA and the
                            set of sub-tools each team would use to deal with the given assignment. This was the main content of our work
                            during this week. Having a target in front of us, we performed a couple of online brainstorming
                            sessions and finally created a nicely looking presentation containing some examples of the application
                            of LFA on imaginary problems. We also included some analytical diagrams and built a corresponding "log frame".
                            Moreover, we spent some time trying to align the presentation design with the Haxoft
                            "company design".

                            On Monday, the announcement of the problem assignments was postponed to Wednesday, which we accepted
                            with a slight disappointment. Despite the bad news, the shifting of the announcement fitted us in the sense
                            that our team was incomplete during this session since one of our team members (Frank) wanted to attend a
                            volunteer engagement in his hometown.
                            <br/>
                            We are looking forward to attending the next planspiel session tomorrow 9th November. We expect to finally
                            receive the problem assignments.

                        <p>In the planspiel session that took place this Wednesday, we presented the core company values
                            we established for Haxoft. Besides that, Prof. Gaedke announced that all the teams have to become familiar
                            with the logical framework approach (LFA). According to his instructions, this should be done before
                            any of the teams get their task assignments. The LFA should provide us with a framework that will guide us during
                            the development of the project and to increase the chances that we eventually deliver a solution that matters.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Until now, we are not sure whether industry partners will be part of the project, or whether
                            our task will be of "internal" nature - as Prof. Gaedke mentioned in some previous sessions.
                            We were informed at the beginning of the planspiel module that it is likely, that an industry
                            partner (a company) will share with us a specific problem they face which could be solved with
                            a software solution. This way, we would be able to work on a solution for a real problem and
                            eventually deliver a software product that matters. However, no project or problem has been
                            assigned to us until now. This is quite confusing however, having in mind the fact that we
                            were asked to think and elaborate our companies mission and vision, without having a
                            connection to a real problem. Some of the issues Prof. Gaedke mentioned he
                            encountered while dealing with some companies, were some concerns regarding the intellectual
                            property laws in Germany.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Despite certain uncertainty with regard to the problem assignment, we started the week with
                            some research about LFA. This in hope the tool could eventually help us when dealing with our future
                            assignment. Each one of us read the sources about LFA provided by the Prof., and we were able
                            to get a solid insight into its main principles and the issues it tackles.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the practical side of our work, we continued to improve some details of the company logo
                            and some minor issues on our company website. At this point, our website matured into a
                            publishable stage. We therefore contacted the computer network administration center of the university
                            and asked for a virtual webserver. This would allow us to publish our website, and to link the domain
                            'haxoft.tu-chemnitz.de' to the IP address of our group's web-space. However, due to university
                            restrictions, this attempt failed. According to the information they provided, we would have
                            to align our website design with the design specified by the TU-Chemnitz and indicate a full-time
                            working university employee who would be responsible for the website content. We were obviously
                            not willing to change our website design, and finding an employee who would be willing to take
                            responsibility for the website content would not be an easy task either. For this reason,
                            we decided to publish the website on a personal user web-space provided by the university.
                            We are currently looking closer into the possibility to rent a URL and link it to this private
                            directory.
                            <br/>
                            As for today, we are looking forward to find out whether we finally get a real problem from a
                            private company. We believe this might happen in the coming weeks.

                        <p>
                        <br>This week had quite a good start due to the positive outcome of the first presentation of our work.
                            In the planspiel meeting this Wednesday, every team was supposed to show what they have achieved.
                            For most of the teams this was obviously not a big amount of work, but nevertheless, we were able to
                            achieve a satisfactory outcome. When comparing with the other teams, we were able to confirm
                            that we have chosen among the best website designs in the class, and a nice looking logo.
                            This was obviously a positive boost to the team's enthusiasm and overall energy.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            After Wednesday meeting, the next step was to come up with the core values of our company.
                            After some online brainstorming sessions and individual thinking about which could be our core values,
                            we met personally on Friday morning to bring our ideas together. Within this meeting, we were able to
                            agree on 8 core values for Haxoft. After writing them down, we noticed that listing them somewhere might
                            give a higher importance to some values while providing less to others. However, we agreed that
                            our core values should all be equally important. For this reason, we decided to arrange the values
                            into a circle, which you can currently see on the main page of the Haxoft website. Under the circle of values,
                            we display the description of the core value that has been selected by the website visitor.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Our team discussions during this week have been growing in size, as the tasks given by our prof. pile up.
                            The communication client Whatsapp seems not to be sufficient anymore, given the fact that all
                            conversations are in one big heap and finding important information about what has been discussed,
                            agreed upon, or rejected is very hard to find as time goes by. Then one of us remembered a tool
                            that was suggested by prof. Gaedke - "Slack". This neat team messaging tool allows you and your
                            teammates to communicate over the internet in a topic-based manner, among other nice features.
                            This turned out to be a good decision. We can already say that Slack has significantly contributed
                            to the improvement of our internal communication.
                            <br/>
                            As we promised last week, we have improved our company logo design. It now has a different shade of
                            red which is more in harmony with our website design, and we also removed some other minor flaws.

                        <p>
                            We are starting our project for module "Planspiel Web Engineering", which will be further called
                            'planspiel' along this log.We created our team in the first planspiel session and mutually exchanged
                            our WhatsApp numbers.Our first task is to come up with a name and a logo for our newly created
                            team - which is easier said than done. After many discussions and brainstorming sessions, we have
                            finally found common ground and decided for one name.
                            As you probably know now, we have decided to name our team and company - 'Haxoft'. But why Haxoft? <br/>
                            Haxoft is a composition of two words - hack and soft. While the reason for choosing soft is probably obvious,
                            the reason why we use 'hack' might not be so. The word „hack“ is used in many contexts nowadays,
                            but originally it means „to produce an ingenious piece of work that solves a meaningful problem“.
                            And that’s what we stand for: game-changing and reliable software that will give you an advantage over
                            your competitors. Curiously enough, the name "Haxoft" was one of the first names that came to our mind.
                            One might, therefore, say we are using a rather spontaneous company name. To give you an example
                            of some of the names that we were considering, we provide you below a brief list with some of them: <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hexoft</li>
                                <li>Coconut Technologies</li>
                                <li>BinaryCase</li>
                                <li>BinaryFactory</li>
                                <li>nerdsco</li>
                                <li>Physalis Systems</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            As you can see, we had a few ideas for the company name and each of them had its own story
                            or "reason" behind it. As mentioned before, the better "ground story" and the most consensual
                            turned out to be Haxoft. <br/>
                            Apart from the tasks of coming up with a name and a logo, we were also asked to build a company
                            web site. Given the fact that there are no web-designers in our team, we decided to lookup a bootstrap
                            template that would have an appropriate "look and feel" to fit our new company name.
                            It didn't took us long and we decided to use the neat template 'BRUSHED' from an italian web-designer Alessio Atzeni.
                            While Luis and Frank filled into the template some initial company content, Valentin was dealing
                            with the design of the Haxoft logo. With the help of inkscape and a couple of youtube tutorials
                            he was able to create an x-cube logo as the visual representation of our company. The first version
                            came to life and it surely had its flaws, but we all agreed those would be removed during the next week.<br/>
                            Besides the Homepage, Frank also created a facebook and a twitter page. This way we aim to have more than one customer chanel.
                            At the end of the week, we created a Trello project and started to use this handy tool to manage our tasks.
