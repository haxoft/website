                          The meeting on wednesday the 14th December was the last meeting as a class of teams with the Prof. Gaedke.
                          Incredible that we are already here at the kick-off for the implementation of our ideas.
                          We were once not happy about the long not knowing about what we really do here as a solution. But somehow this meeting was a high step forward.
                          And we recognized, that we did not much the week before.
                          Ok, we also had no clue where we should really go ahead, because we still had several good ideas.
                          And we did not really made a decision on what idea we want to focus.
                          But then suddenly we had to.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Because the Professor wanted to meet us two days after the wednesday meeting. And he wants to meet each team separately.
                          Within this meeting, we should present him our idea for the planspiel - or rather our product.
                          So we had again several discussion via slack, which idea we should choose.
                          In the end, we came to our <B>H</B>axoft e<B>X</B>traction <B>T</B>ool (HXT).
                          Which was at the start of the meeting at Friday the 16th very briefly prototyped.
                          We already had many ideas, how we want to evolve and develop HXT, but we had not really sketched them into a prototype or a demo mockup.
                          In our first presentation of our ideas at the end of November, we already had a shortly drawn paper prototype for HXT, but it was one of the small ones.
                          So Prof. Gaedke was quite satisfied and contented about our idea, but also deplored that we only had on ruff sketch of our idea.
                          Hence the task for the holiday season was clear. We need really a good prototype.
                          And not only a paper prototype in the end, we want to have a clickable prototype of our idea.
                          Moreover now know, what we have to include in our report at the end of the semester.
                          Three parts are therefore important. At first our team log. Well that is what you actually read here.
                          A log or maybe diary about us as a team and how we experienced the whole planspiel.
                          As a second part we should provide a business plan and finally we also should of course have a description part about our product.
                          While the first and the last part was very clear to us all, we all have not much experience on writing a business plan.
                          Therefore we splat our high priority tasks to different people. Frank and Luis focused thereby on the prototype and Valentin focused on the business plan research.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Furthermore we also had as mentioned before two more interviews.
                          Unfortunately not all of us could come to each interview, but at every interview were at least two of us.
                          Spontaneously we also changed a bit our interview plan. Because we did not need anymore those deep details on what they are doing at project planning.
                          Additionally those topics were for us pretty clear through our first two interviews with guys from the telekom.
                          Because one company is not doing it totally different that much.
                          Of course we asked them shortly about their phases of planning, but they told us the same keywords as the other ones, hence it was as we thought.
                          What we did instead was asking them, if they would be interested in our idea - the HXT.
                          The response was not that positive, but we knew also before, that those guys do not write proposals that much.
                          Or not with such high strict requirements.
                          So it was not bad news, but confirmation of our assumptions.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          While we had our typical visits at our family by christmas and celebrated somehow the new year, we took as much time as possible to build our paper prototype
                          and get more knowledge on writing a business plan.
                          Within the end of the year we also had a paper prototype, we all agreed on.

                      <p>
                          With again no meeting in the week, this week does not happend that much new.
                          We of course continued to get some interviews, but the holiday season was therefore not a good friend.
                          Many people rejected us, due to pre christmas stress.
                          Actually they maybe are not interested to get interviewed by us at all, but that was mostly what they said.
                          But we had also success regarding two more interviewees from telekom for the end of the week and the beginning of next week.
                          Unfortunately we had also a little dispute about our preferred idea.
                          The good thing here is that whenever we have a little dispute, mostly everyone of us is interested in solving it
                          and not, as also one of our values demands, blame one of us. Beside of those personalities harming quite good, we also experienced our perfect team size.
                          The good thing about three guys in a team is, that mostly only two guys have much to discuss or rather argue against each other.
                          So one of us can always bring the other two back to a line of agreement by having simply a bit a distance to the discussion.
                          So even if we do not directly agree to each other, we have already our methods to go on as one team.

                  <div class="span8 info-block" align=justify>
                      <p>Ok, yes. We somehow ended up in the last log with a sort of cliffhanger. And yes we did not explain to you all the ideas.
                          Well of course we could not, because those are our ideas and unfortunately we want to bring them up to you, if we have a more detailed view.
                          To comeback to our logging, we had to show up at our wednesday meeting of the planspiel.
                          And we had to present, what we did the last weeks. Hence we presented our results from the interviews.
                          So we sketched alignment maps for each of our interviewees, for a better visualization.
                          Moreover we presented our first paper prototypes of our corresponding ideas.
                          Well, we did not present all, but four of them.
                          Two of them a bit more detailed and the other two a bit more ruff. What means that we simply draw one very simple mockup on one piece of paper for the simpler ones.
                          Prof. Gaedke somehow demurred at our more detailed ideas, because he remembers some tools, which already supporting such issues.
                          And those are not really successfully. So we could get of course even better then they are, but we need to have it clearly in mind.
                          From our point of view, it was very interesting, that no one of our interviewees came to the point, that those tools somehow exists or he used them.
                          In the retrospective it is of course clear that by only four interviewees, such things could maybe not get mentioned.
                          But at all, we did not think about that before. So therefore we learned here again, that asking more people is always better.
                          Thus we were maybe a bit to happy about our ideas to be enough impartial.
                          Furthermore Prof. Gaedke claimed that we only interviewed four person. For us it was so much new information, that we did not really think about interviewing more in this period.
                          Besides the fact, that those interviews always need alot of preparing time due to connecting to potential interview partners and stipulating an appointment.
                          But of course interviewing more would be better. So for that Prof. Gaedke told us all, that we need at least ten interviewees.
                          So we started over to get some more interview partners.
                          By doing that we discussed alot about our ideas to form them to a newer, more detailed level of perception.
                          Furthermore we added some ideas and scraped some not good enough ones.
                          So how can we say, they are not good enough?
                          Well if no one of us sees real capability behind it with our current skill level, then it is not good enough stay in our current focus.
                          So for example we had some ideas, which were very cool but we were not sure about the feasibility by us three.
                          Some of them were so big, that we could not come to a point of having a clear idea, how we will perform and build a MVP within this semester.
                          Hence we sorted them out of our list.

                          This entry of our log is the first one going over two weeks. Due to some conferences and some abroad meetings of Prof. Gaedke,
                          there are no meetings until the 30th November. Within this two weeks we managed one big purpose - our interviews.
                          Hence it is not that much difference between the weeks for us, it is also not for our log.
                          So we contacted project planners we know and asked them for an interview and even asked them, if they know more guys, who would probably let us interview them.
                          <br/>
                          With some circumstances we closed the two weeks with somehow 'only' four interviews. But those interviews were all great for getting knowledge about our potential customers.
                          We interviewed so far two guys from Deutsche Telekom, further on only called telekom, and two guys from the university or rather the VSR professorship.
                          The guys from the professorship strongly talked about proposals in the context of project planning, because they need to get money from financing institutions
                          like the European Commission (EC) or the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft (DFG).
                          So they mainly focused on how they could get the money for their ideas within their scope of possibilities, where as the guys from telekom mostly do not have the decision on if they have the money or not.
                          They told us, that mostly only the vice-presidents or rather the senior-vice-presidents of the department decide whether for this idea is money bestowed or not.
                          So the ideas of on what the project is built is very different from project to project.
                          And they have also about 4 different schemes of project management and thereby different plannings.
                          They still perform sometimes a nearby waterfall-model and so a very strict planing phase.
                          The other three different types of project management within specific teams, is a bit more less planed due to agile development.
                          There are scrum teams, some mixed teams, which perform scrum without strictly roles within one team and there is the idea of kanban coming up.
                          All those more agile versions, perform less planing due to the kept opened mind of all involved to non limit the agile increment.
                          Moreover we found out that the telekom uses mostly common products, like powerpoint, or own products to help project planners.
                          This is somehow sometimes also a pain point, but it could be also be really hard to influence such a big company to perform now totally different and buy some
                          supporting software from our company. But of course we also thought about ideas how we could help those guys.
                          In the end we have about eight ideas now. And that makes us all pretty happy.

                        <p>So finally we have our own issue, which we can solve. And build a solution that matters.
                            No. Wait. We do not have such an issue. There are no industrial partners working with us directly
                            in cooperation. So yeah, we are disappointed. Because somehow it would be really cool to work with
                            industrial partners from the very beginning. Unfortunately it seems to be so that no german company
                            wants to work with students and builds thereby a competitor or solution supplier for one of their main tasks.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            BUT we still can deliver a product that matters - or rather a solution that matters.
                            So if no one comes to us and presents us his problems and pain points out of his motivation to solve them,
                            we will help them and go out of the office to interview potential customers. But wait if we do not have
                            a clear idea right now what we want to build, where are our potential customers settled down?
                            Well Prof. Gaedke there somehow limited us, the teams of the current planspiel, to bring in an idea to somehow help guys, who plan projects.
                            With the knowledge of LFA and even more about some other Frameworks like HCD out of the lectures from Prof. Gaedke we have some an idea what is done by those.
                            That this could be only an idea and the reality strictly works differently was directly in our mind,
                            but we faced the challenge to find some the ideas we need to emplace our company to its 'living rights'.
                            Hence Prof. Gaedke somehow brought us a motivation to go on, but thereby strictly limited us to software for project planning.
                            And everyone of us is not that happy to develop a solution in this dimension. But still we will face it and talk to project planners.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            So to successfully hold an interview, you need some questions prepared. Therefore everyone of us brainstormed on his own and took some short notes.
                            After this short phase of orientation, we sat together and merged our ideas to a detailed plan, what we want to ask.
                            As a starting point our plan determines some easy question about our interview partner.
                            So how long she or he worked already as a project planner and what her or his current position is named.
                            With this introduction knowledge we can on one side help the interviewed one to get started in the answering flow with easy to answer questions
                            and on the other side we can later on better compare the different results from the interviews - so somehow classify them a bit.
                            Then we want to ask them which processes the apply to plan a project and if they maybe implemented standard approaches like LFA.
                            If they do not have any standard approach implemented, they should provide us with their follow up plan to come to a project plan.
                            After knowing their processes or may rather phases of creating a plan for a new project, we want to ask them detailed questions on each phase.
                            Like what are the inputs and outputs of the different phase, what they do there usually and based on which requirements they maybe need to finish this phase.
                            Moreover we want to ask them for the tools they use for project planning in each of those phases and if there are pain points anywhere.
                            Those pain points of course do not need to be only in a software, but also in other structural pursuits.
                            And maybe some phases are poorly supported?
                            <br/>
                            Furthermore we want to asked them, why they do the things the way they do it.
                            And maybe there can be different types of proposals and therefore different processes to think about.
                            In the end of the interview we want to them to grade each phase or tool with 1 to 5.
                            This will hopefully also help us to uncover pain points they even do not directly mention.

                        <p>Unfortunately and against our expectations, this weeks planspiel session didn't bring much new
                            information regarding the problem assignments. We left the session slightly disappointed
                            and with a feeling that we keep standing on the same spot, and not moving forward with the project.
                            The LFA tool was once more introduced by Prof. Gaedke, and since each one of us
                            had already read the sources, we took it as a revision of our knowledge. In the previous session,
                            all the teams were instructed to read the sources about LFA and therefore we felt that
                            the session was a bit wasted.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            However, we did receive one good message from the Prof. - he announced that problem
                            assignments should be presented during the upcoming week, probably on Monday, after the presentations
                            of our current work. The presentations were supposed to contain each team's findings regarding the LFA and the
                            set of sub-tools each team would use to deal with the given assignment. This was the main content of our work
                            during this week. Having a target in front of us, we performed a couple of online brainstorming
                            sessions and finally created a nicely looking presentation containing some examples of the application
                            of LFA on imaginary problems. We also included some analytical diagrams and built a corresponding "log frame".
                            Moreover, we spent some time trying to align the presentation design with the Haxoft
                            "company design".
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On Monday, the announcement of the problem assignments was postponed to Wednesday, which we accepted
                            with a slight disappointment. Despite the bad news, the shifting of the announcement fitted us in the sense
                            that our team was incomplete during this session since one of our team members (Frank) wanted to attend a
                            volunteer engagement in his hometown.
                            <br/>
                            We are looking forward to attending the next planspiel session tomorrow 9th November. We expect to finally
                            receive the problem assignments.

                        <p>In the planspiel session that took place this Wednesday, we presented the core company values
                            we established for Haxoft. Besides that, Prof. Gaedke announced that all the teams have to become familiar
                            with the logical framework approach (LFA). According to his instructions, this should be done before
                            any of the teams get their task assignments. The LFA should provide us with a framework that will guide us during
                            the development of the project and to increase the chances that we eventually deliver a solution that matters.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Until now, we are not sure whether industry partners will be part of the project, or whether
                            our task will be of "internal" nature - as Prof. Gaedke mentioned in some previous sessions.
                            We were informed at the beginning of the planspiel module that it is likely, that an industry
                            partner (a company) will share with us a specific problem they face which could be solved with
                            a software solution. This way, we would be able to work on a solution for a real problem and
                            eventually deliver a software product that matters. However, no project or problem has been
                            assigned to us until now. This is quite confusing however, having in mind the fact that we
                            were asked to think and elaborate our companies mission and vision, without having a
                            connection to a real problem. Some of the issues Prof. Gaedke mentioned he
                            encountered while dealing with some companies, were some concerns regarding the intellectual
                            property laws in Germany.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Despite certain uncertainty with regard to the problem assignment, we started the week with
                            some research about LFA. This in hope the tool could eventually help us when dealing with our future
                            assignment. Each one of us read the sources about LFA provided by the Prof., and we were able
                            to get a solid insight into its main principles and the issues it tackles.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the practical side of our work, we continued to improve some details of the company logo
                            and some minor issues on our company website. At this point, our website matured into a
                            publishable stage. We therefore contacted the computer network administration center of the university
                            and asked for a virtual webserver. This would allow us to publish our website, and to link the domain
                            'haxoft.tu-chemnitz.de' to the IP address of our group's web-space. However, due to university
                            restrictions, this attempt failed. According to the information they provided, we would have
                            to align our website design with the design specified by the TU-Chemnitz and indicate a full-time
                            working university employee who would be responsible for the website content. We were obviously
                            not willing to change our website design, and finding an employee who would be willing to take
                            responsibility for the website content would not be an easy task either. For this reason,
                            we decided to publish the website on a personal user web-space provided by the university.
                            We are currently looking closer into the possibility to rent a URL and link it to this private
                            directory.
                            <br/>
                            As for today, we are looking forward to find out whether we finally get a real problem from a
                            private company. We believe this might happen in the coming weeks.

                        <br>This week had quite a good start due to the positive outcome of the first presentation of our work.
                            In the planspiel meeting this Wednesday, every team was supposed to show what they have achieved.
                            For most of the teams this was obviously not a big amount of work, but nevertheless, we were able to
                            achieve a satisfactory outcome. When comparing with the other teams, we were able to confirm
                            that we have chosen among the best website designs in the class, and a nice looking logo.
                            This was obviously a positive boost to the team's enthusiasm and overall energy.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            After Wednesday meeting, the next step was to come up with the core values of our company.
                            After some online brainstorming sessions and individual thinking about which could be our core values,
                            we met personally on Friday morning to bring our ideas together. Within this meeting, we were able to
                            agree on 8 core values for Haxoft. After writing them down, we noticed that listing them somewhere might
                            give a higher importance to some values while providing less to others. However, we agreed that
                            our core values should all be equally important. For this reason, we decided to arrange the values
                            into a circle, which you can currently see on the main page of the Haxoft website. Under the circle of values,
                            we display the description of the core value that has been selected by the website visitor.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Our team discussions during this week have been growing in size, as the tasks given by our prof. pile up.
                            The communication client Whatsapp seems not to be sufficient anymore, given the fact that all
                            conversations are in one big heap and finding important information about what has been discussed,
                            agreed upon, or rejected is very hard to find as time goes by. Then one of us remembered a tool
                            that was suggested by prof. Gaedke - "Slack". This neat team messaging tool allows you and your
                            teammates to communicate over the internet in a topic-based manner, among other nice features.
                            This turned out to be a good decision. We can already say that Slack has significantly contributed
                            to the improvement of our internal communication.
                            <br/>
                            As we promised last week, we have improved our company logo design. It now has a different shade of
                            red which is more in harmony with our website design, and we also removed some other minor flaws.

                            We are starting our project for module "Planspiel Web Engineering", which will be further called
                            'planspiel' along this log.We created our team in the first planspiel session and mutually exchanged
                            our WhatsApp numbers.Our first task is to come up with a name and a logo for our newly created
                            team - which is easier said than done. After many discussions and brainstorming sessions, we have
                            finally found common ground and decided for one name.
                            As you probably know now, we have decided to name our team and company - 'Haxoft'. But why Haxoft? <br/>
                            Haxoft is a composition of two words - hack and soft. While the reason for choosing soft is probably obvious,
                            the reason why we use 'hack' might not be so. The word „hack“ is used in many contexts nowadays,
                            but originally it means „to produce an ingenious piece of work that solves a meaningful problem“.
                            And that’s what we stand for: game-changing and reliable software that will give you an advantage over
                            your competitors. Curiously enough, the name "Haxoft" was one of the first names that came to our mind.
                            One might, therefore, say we are using a rather spontaneous company name. To give you an example
                            of some of the names that we were considering, we provide you below a brief list with some of them: <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hexoft</li>
                                <li>Coconut Technologies</li>
                                <li>BinaryCase</li>
                                <li>BinaryFactory</li>
                                <li>nerdsco</li>
                                <li>Physalis Systems</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            As you can see, we had a few ideas for the company name and each of them had its own story
                            or "reason" behind it. As mentioned before, the better "ground story" and the most consensual
                            turned out to be Haxoft. <br/>
                            Apart from the tasks of coming up with a name and a logo, we were also asked to build a company
                            web site. Given the fact that there are no web-designers in our team, we decided to lookup a bootstrap
                            template that would have an appropriate "look and feel" to fit our new company name.
                            It didn't took us long and we decided to use the neat template 'BRUSHED' from an italian web-designer Alessio Atzeni.
                            While Luis and Frank filled into the template some initial company content, Valentin was dealing
                            with the design of the Haxoft logo. With the help of inkscape and a couple of youtube tutorials
                            he was able to create an x-cube logo as the visual representation of our company. The first version
                            came to life and it surely had its flaws, but we all agreed those would be removed during the next week.<br/>
                            Besides the Homepage, Frank also created a facebook and a twitter page. This way we aim to have more than one customer chanel.
                            At the end of the week, we created a Trello project and started to use this handy tool to manage our tasks.
