                          What a start of a week! We expected to meet the Prof. this week.
                          As he said last week, we will meet probably on Tuesday, we did not even thought about a meeting before Tuesday.
                          But it came differently... <br/>
                          Differently than expected? A challenge to proof our strength our ability of adjusting to different and unexpected circumstances!
                          So what happend actually? At monday we received around 11 am. that we have the chance to meet the professor this day at the late afternoon.
                          Moreover he called it a window of opportunity (WOO) and explained that the meeting will be the meeting how we want to be it.
                          Every team will get 15 minutes and can decide on its own, what will be important at the meeting.
                          As the teams should organize the schedule them selves, we called as the other two teams before, what our timeslot will be.
                          So it was not really an organizing between the teams, but a first come first serve schedule for the appointments. <br/>
                          However, we had to deal with the unexpected meeting a day before and of course we planed initially to solve some work tasks
                          later on monday afternoon or evening. So we had to improvise a bit.
                          As our UI was currently not working as well as we want it to show anyone, we decided to stay away from it and focused on the
                          progress we made the last weeks. And as you read the last entries of our log, yes the UI was not so deep in our focus.
                          To get some ideas about the pitch at the end of the planspiel, we also asked the professor some questions accordingly.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As the week proceeded, we were continuing working on our different purposes we had also last week.
                          Writing our businessplan was the logical next step after our first thoughts last week.
                          With our work on our 10/10/10 business plan, our CANVAS model, our specified core values and the SWOT analysis of ourselves we already did some work
                          relating the businessplan. And even if the CANVAS is somehow the summary of the business plan there are still many gaps for a full business plan.
                          Thus we started to write our business plan and alter the gaps to worked-out details.
                          Until now we are finished with around the half of the plan and have now really a quite detailed market entry strategy. Wow!
                          We did not even expect to have one at the beginning of the planspiel. Maybe also because we did not thought we will need one, but still it is a new experience for us
                          to go in such a detail of economy stuff. Obviously, some ideas were covered in some lectures at university or even in some classes at school, but noone of us actually
                          used them before in practice. Ok, the planspiel is still not that real as we are somehow still studying, but it is needless to say that we can still call it to be very
                          practically oriented - at least for a student.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          We also kept going on in our core feature of extracting knowledge with IR queries.
                          On the one side we need to include it our progress to our HXT and on the other side we need to go on with developing extractions for even more requirements.
                          <a><br/>HEY maybe Frank can write something here about his work?</a>
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          For the next week we plan to finish finally the businessplan and to go on even further with our core feature of the HXT.
                          Moreover we should keep in mind that the pitch is coming closer and closer and that means, we should start also to catch some bullet points for our solution description
                          in our final report for the planspiel.

                          Another week has passed and against expectations, we were not able to meet our customer.
                          Originally, we expected to see Prof. Gaedke on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he did not have time for a meeting.
                          It is quite hard to make significant progress in a project without showing it to somebody who is not directly involved in it. We
                          have been missing a more frequent input from an "external viewer" along the development.
                          As we also experienced, it is motivating to know that the customer is interested in our product and being able to
                          discuss some details with him is crucial to keep the right direction during development.
                          Having that in mind, weekly meetings would be a nice thing to have.
                          This way, we would be able to have more frequent feedback on how we performed/are performing and the adjustments we should make.
                          We are however still doing our best to deal with the current conditions and situation. After all, adjusting to
                          unexpected situations is a key skill of any development team.
                          It is worth mentioning that we very much appreciate the possibility to be consulting issues regarding our emerging product
                          with our Prof., as his planspiel role is twofold: our counselor and the first customer at the same time.
                          <br/>
                          After the original Wednesday meeting, which did not take place, we received information from the Prof. that the next
                          customer meeting should be on Tuesday next week. We are looking forward to it!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regardless of whether the meeting took place or not, we continued with the development of the HXT and the corresponding tasks.
                          Having in mind the fact that the planspiel is coming to its end, we started to sketch out our business plan.
                          Our business model served as a good foundation for this purpose. Within this week, we made some notes about different
                          thoughts we collected and drafted the concrete sections. In order to have the first draft of our business plan, we will have to
                          do some more research and continue with the task during the next week.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As we already mentioned, the development of the project still continues. We managed to add user management
                          to the backend and the frontend of the application, as well as the corresponding session management. This functionality
                          allows the HXT to recognize different users (with different access rights) and to serve resources to these users accordingly.
                          One part of this functionality that was especially time-consuming was the authentication of users (user agents) making requests
                          to the HXT plugin. The user management is handled at the "front-line" by <a target="_blank" href="https://de.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>
                          and our plugin just simply receives a "claim" containing the information about the user making the request. This kind of delegated
                          authentication was a bit confusing at the beginning since it comprises 3 entities (Atlassian, HXT, User agent)
                          sending and receiving a <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>.
                          <br/>
                          To close this entry with some good news, we are happy to announce that we are now very close to the first
                          automated extraction of some important proposal requirements! We have found the first two optimized
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">IR queries</a> for extraction of our
                          first two requirements (which are both very big and ugly creatures) and we are currently trying to insert them in the
                          extraction module of the HXT plugin.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          So we finally did it! Our weekly log is now fully complete until this point and everybody is free to read it on our website and follow
                          us during the development. We also introduced some hyperlinks for an improved reader experience, especially for those without
                          deeper technical knowledge. From now on, we have committed to deliver new entries as new weeks come. This way, we should be able to
                          describe in more detail what we exactly achieved and what lies in front of us - always from the perspective of the current point in time.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regarding the events that occurred this week, we were again not able to meet with Prof. Gaedke. Nevertheless, we met each other in order
                          to coordinate the following steps, as we do every week. Within this meeting, we agreed on some details regarding the core component that
                          provides the information extraction functionality for the HXT plugin.
                          <br/>
                          Another high priority requirement to implement is the user and session management. This functionality forms the basis for allowing
                          project sharing among users. Project sharing is among some of the features we intended to support, but we are not confident we will
                          be able to finish it before the final pitch/presentation day. Nevertheless, the system should be ready for such an extension.
                          The current state of the plugin does not support any user management and only recognizes a single user, which should be changed as soon
                          as possible. In order to support user management, we will have to connect the plugin backend with the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/concepts/authentication.html">
                              Atlassian authentication</a>
                          flow and user management system.
                          This trilateral process (user, HXT, Atlassian) will maybe take some effort and time, but we are confident that we will figure it out.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          After finishing all the entries of this log (which takes a significant amount of time), we continued to improve out our
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">CANVAS model</a>.
                          The first version of our CANVAS was consulted with Prof. Gaedke two weeks ago at our customer meeting. To summarize the outcome
                          we can say that he was not particularly happy with the fact that we did not present any meaningful financial entries
                          in our "costs section". We did not leave the entire section out, but the entries were not carefully thought out and they
                          lacked some detailed reasoning - an economist would say that our numbers "were not adding up". In order to fix this, we set up
                          a team meeting and performed some brainstorming on the different reasons and sources of different financial entries.
                          At the end, we were able to finish the CANVAS. This time with some more realistic numbers inside it. This version might potentially
                          serve as a basis for the communication with investors since it shows the basic reasoning behind our economic viability - how much
                          money we want to earn, how we want to earn it, the basic costs of running our company and some other economic details.

                          Without having a customer meeting this week, we simply continued with our work. We did some collective
                          remembering of our work contributions and added some content to this log. The task of maintaining a weekly
                          log is quite tedious and time-consuming, especially when we have to do it retrospectively. We have been
                          obviously writing some notes regarding our continuous progress in the project, but having to formulate our
                          thoughts and putting them in a coherent story line is a surprisingly strenuous activity (especially for developers).
                          <br/>
                          We suspect that writing our entry logs right at the end of each week would make this task somehow easier. However,
                          due to different circumstances, we have been failing to do so until now. On the other hand, we have been successful in
                          writing down at least some notes about our progress within the last weeks - especially after customer meetings with the Prof.
                          We have been trying to catch-up the weekly log debt that has been piling up, and we hope to balance the situation next week, when
                          we hopefully finish all the entries.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          The team meeting this week delivered some promising results. As a result of our brainstorming, we were able to come with
                          some very promising ideas for the core module of the HXT - the module responsible for the requirements extraction. After
                          some research and discussions we have come up with two different approaches of how to deal with the core functionality - one
                          uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">Information Retrieval</a> and the other
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction">Information Extraction</a>.
                          Despite their similar names, the two approaches are
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Information-Extraction-and-Information-Retrieval">
                              quite different</a>.
                          One is more related to Natural Language Processing, and the other is rather based on full-text indexing.
                          In the following weeks, we should elaborate a "proof of concept" example for each of them and after that, we will
                          be able to decide for the most promising in terms of time consumption vs effectiveness.
                          <br/>
                          As already mentioned, the second approach is based on Information Extraction(IE) and potentially more
                          complex and time-consuming. In an ideal world, we would have more time (at least more than 3 months) for the implementation
                          and we would be able to use both approaches in the HXT. The reality, however, is that we have to deliver a running
                          MVP at the middle of March, which is quite restrictive in terms of time possibilities.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Apart from researching about different approaches to solve our main problem, we also looked around for some python libraries which
                          would help us with the task. Moreover, we collected and agreed upon some of the most relevant requirements that the HXT
                          plugin should be able to extract. It is a long list and we are not sure that we can deliver them all before the final pitch day, but
                          we will definitely try hard.
                          <br/>
                          We were aware of the fact that in case we decide ourselves for the IR approach, we will have to build several queries that
                          would match each type of requirement. For this reason, we started to sketch such queries - mainly for the most common and simple
                          requirements. It is worth mentioning that our list of the top-priority requirements to extract was previously consulted with
                          one of our early "potential customer"/stakeholder/interviewee - a member of the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/about/people/">VSR team</a>. We arranged a brief consultation
                          in order to find out whether our list was accurate, and did not contain unnecessary / irrelevant requirements.

                          This week's meeting with Prof. Gaedke did not deliver an entirely satisfactory outcome. We met him
                          on Monday, as in the previous weeks, and he was not too happy with the results we presented.
                          The reason for his dissatisfaction was the amount of work we presented to him. We worked last week on
                          the backend and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">
                          REST API </a>, which is not an easily presentable functionality. For this reason, we did
                          not have a click-able/dynamic/shiny demo to show. As we understood him, we should be always able
                          to deliver an increment - a working demonstration - of whatever we have built. This is not always possible
                          in our opinion, but we did get the message.
                          <br/>
                          If we knew in advance, that delivering a working "something" is a top priority, we are pretty confident we would
                          be able to come up with something to show. After all, our UI is relatively ahead in terms of its development degree,
                          so with a bit more of effort, we would be able to connect the working backend with the UI - at least partially.
                          The lesson we learned this week is quite clear - no more meetings without working increments!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Apart from the backend, we worked on the research side, our homepage and of course the CANVAS. This week,
                          we need to focus more on the magic part. Until now, the only team member doing research about our
                          magical (core) functionality has been Valentin. This should, however, change as soon as possible
                          since we agreed that the core functionality is far too important and it should not be just handled by a single
                          team member. For this reason, Frank and Luis also started this week with reading some papers about the
                          topic. Hopefully, as we proceed with the research and more of us get familiar with the topic, we will be
                          able to come up with more ideas and to deliver better results.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          In order to have a product increment for the next meeting (hopefully some day next week), we will continue with
                          the connection of the backend with the UI. We are confident what most of the work could be finished
                          by next Monday. We also started to write some <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">
                          unit tests</a> for the backend. We are currently testing only
                          a subset of the backend functionality, but that will change as we go further with the project. The amount
                          of code on the server has been increasing significantly, and we feel that it is the right time for
                          some testing.
                          <br/>
                          The entries in this log are newly available through the "see what's going on" button - as you probably noticed since
                          you are reading this log already. Enjoy!

                          During the customer meeting on Monday, we summarized and presented our work from the previous week. We also briefed him
                          about our plans for further development, and the amount of work we should deliver in the upcoming sessions. We did not
                          finish the meeting in a fully satisfactory way however. We presented him some amount of work, but we also felt that it was not
                          much and this was also the reason why the meeting was so short.
                          <br/>
                          The Prof. did not provide us with much feedback, but he did have a requirement. Until now, we have been
                          informing him about our results only verbally and without any written reports. This should however change, given
                          that he required that we start writing a "work log". This way, we would be able to continuously inform our (potential) customers
                          about the latest news regarding the product development. He also mentioned that it would be nice to inform more our
                          customers about the product itself. Moreover, he suggested we provide a description of our product in our website.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          We did as he asked, and updated our website with the information about our product.
                          We introduced a first version of our product description and added two
                          buttons: one redirecting to our product click-able prototype, and the other redirecting to our work log. We held
                          a brainstorming session in order to elaborate and polish the sentences about the product. After all, a catchy sentence
                          is the first thing a potential customer should see, when he enters our website.
                          <br/>
                          Besides the changes in our website, we also worked on the system's backend. We first designed the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">entity relationship (ER)</a>
                          model that describes the entities in the system. After some brainstorming sessions, we were able to
                          accept the first working version and we created a digital diagram for documentation purposes. After that, we implemented
                          the ER model in Django, by writing the code that defines the backend persistence models.
                          <br/>
                          We also managed to achieve some progress on our research regarding
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>.
                          We now know, that our problem can be solved by using at least two approaches. The first is Information Retrieval (IR) which
                          is mainly used for searching information inside documents. To put it simple, every search engine uses IR for processing a search
                          request.
                          <br/>
                          The second approach is Information Extraction(IE). This approach is more about extracting knowledge from text. It uses
                          classifiers, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and other fancy methods belonging to AI.
                          Both methods could be very useful in our future efforts to solve the problem of requirements extraction.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          The last issue we dealt with, was our first CANVAS model. We did it by using a set of tools available at
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/">leanstack.com</a>. The tool helped us to
                          materialize and shape the ideas we already had in our minds, but which were until now quite abstract.
                          The more ideas we could find, the better. For this reason, we agreed on that each one of us would
                          create his own canvas model and then presented it to the rest of the team. When finished, we merged
                          our ideas and created the final digital CANVAS model.

                          This weeks customer meeting was quite extensive! The consultation with Prof. Gaedke lasted about an hour.
                          Apparently, there were many things we had to discuss. We presented him the first version of our clickable
                          prototype, the first version of our business plan and the results of our research regarding
                          calls for proposals.
                          <br/>
                          We shared with him our idea of building a desktop application and showed him our clickable prototype.
                          He did not like very much the idea of building a "thick" desktop
                          client. We were told that students of a Web Engineering program should be building web applications, not
                          desktop apps. We have been obviously discussing inside the team, the different types of applications we could
                          build, but none of us saw enough arguments for building a web app. The professor, however, seemed to have many
                          arguments about why we should build a web application instead. We must say most of them were quite convincing. Among
                          some of the arguments he shared with us was that distributing a desktop app is more difficult than simply
                          creating an account in a web app, or adding a plugin to an existing platform like "Wordpress" or "Atlassian".
                          Another argument was the functionality of shared projects. It is much easier to share projects in a web app than
                          a desktop client.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          One very good point the Prof. made, was his suggestion about creating an application as a part of an already existing,
                          well-established ecosystem. A plugin or extension that could leverage the success of a third party product, by using
                          its existing plugin distribution system such as the Atlassian marketplace, Microsoft Windows Store app, Google play or
                          similar application distribution centers. This was a very good idea which we readily adopted.
                          <br/>
                          We left from this meeting convinced that it would really be a better choice to build a web application. We will
                          have to slightly change the prototype design, but not entirely. The structure will remain the same, but some
                          components will have to be replaced in order to achieve a better "web" feeling.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Somewhere in the middle of the meeting, the Prof. asked us, if our business "scale". We did not know what he meant, nor
                          what to answer. We understood the importance of the question after he explained what he exactly meant. Put simply, a business
                          scales, if it can growth revenue with minimal or no increase in operating costs. This question was tightly bound to his
                          suggestion about exploiting an existing ecosystem. We could increase our growth without increasing the costs required for marketing.
                          Having learned something new and interesting, we continued with the interview.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To summarize our progress over the week, we can state that we conducted some research and held a couple of brainstorming
                          sessions about the possible platforms we could use to build our application. After that, we concluded that
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://de.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> is the best option. We chose this platform for its
                          prevalence among research groups as well as its appealing plugin architecture. The architecture is surprisingly
                          flexible. The plugin (add-on in the Atlassian terminology) is a common web application that serves HTML
                          content over the internet to the Atlassian product. The served content is then inserted in an Atlassian "IFrame" and
                          served to the user as if it was content from Atlassian. This provides a seamless integration of the add-on and the
                          Atlassian product, and at the same time provides an extreme level of flexibility.
                          <br/>
                          Another advantage of building the add-on as a web application is that we could very easily extend the system
                          in order to publish a standalone version of it. The UI might remain unchanged, as well as the backend. The only
                          modification we would have to make would be regarding the authentication of users. We would have to provide our own
                          user management since the add-on uses delegated auth provided by Atlassian. This, however, is not at all difficult nor costly.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          During the meeting, we also showed the Prof. a SWOT Analysis we created with the help of a tool available at
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cayenneapps.com/swot-analysis">cayenneapps.com</a>. While doing the analysis,
                          we gained an interesting insight into our emerging company. The analysis forced us to think about our current
                          situation from an external point of view.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          After the meeting, we managed to develop the first version of the user interface. We also created
                          the skeleton of our Django server and configured a Postgres database. We also managed to do
                          two more interviews with the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/about/people/">VSRians</a>
                          and started with our research about NLP. This topic seems to be more extensive than we initially thought.

                          We did not have a customer meeting this week. Nevertheless, we continued with our idea for building the HXT.
                          We built an interactive clickable pdf prototype. You can test it right
                          <a target="_blank" href="HaxoftExtractionTool.pdf">here</a> at our website!
                          <br/>
                          Furthermore, we interviewed another stakeholder. The next victim that we robbed of an hour of his time,
                          and gave nothing in exchange, was Prof. Benn. The interview happened on Wednesday this week. First, he
                          shared with us his opinion regarding the small probability anybody would need a tool for project proposal
                          writing. We were quite surprised and disappointed at the same time. We were thinking, is it possible that
                          we have been working on a tool without a potential market? Later in the interview, we showed him exactly what we
                          meant by a tool for supporting project planners. We showed him our clickable prototype. After the demonstration,
                          he realized what we exactly had in mind and he admitted our tool could be interesting for many people - of course
                          assuming we would be able to achieve a smart extraction. This was, however, very motivating. At the end of the
                          discussion, he even asked us to write him an email later in the semester, so he can attend to the final pitch
                          presentation.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          In order to reach a wider audience regarding our customer interviews, we decided to write down a set of questions
                          in the form of a Google Form and to send it to all project managers we could be able to find on Facebook, LinkedIn
                          or other social platforms. We could even use emails, but this seems to be a bit complicated, given the fact
                          that our personal contact list does not contain a significant amount of project managers. Each one of us is able
                          to collect just a few.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To mention other activities, we also did some research regarding relevant requirements in call for proposals.
                          Each one of us tried to find different types from different agencies and we collected a significant amount of
                          documents. We gained a solid idea of the typical structure of these documents and recognized that the European
                          Commission calls were the most coherently structured. The DFG documents, on the other hand, were quite
                          disordered and the structure differed significantly from document to document. The predictable structure
                          of the EU proposals was a convincing argument for choosing them as the initial source for the requirements extraction.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Last but not least, we assembled a brainstorming session and sketched out our first business plan draft.
                          It is based on the 10/10/10 business plan from Alex Glassey, which can be found at
                          <a target="_blank" href="http://alexglassey.com/2016/12/business-planning-season-ugh/">AlexGlassey.com</a>.
                          The brainstorming session revealed that we still have many opened questions regarding our business model.
                          We all agreed to keep working on those and to write down our first business plan in the upcoming week.

                          This week's meeting (held on Wednesday 14th of December) was the last class-meeting where all the
                          teams attended the lecture of Prof. Gaedke. It is quite a relief to finally know the task we should
                          work on. During the first weeks of the planspiel, we struggled a bit because of the delay with which
                          the tasks were communicated to us, but now, everything is different. Finally knowing the topic for our
                          project, we were able to start thinking about the possible tools we could build. We had several quite
                          solid ideas but we were not able to firmly decide which one to implement.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As we soon found out, we had to hurry up with the final decision because the Prof. wanted to meet us
                          two days after the Wednesday meeting. Each team was supposed to meet him separately and to present their
                          ideas for the application. We then assembled a brainstorming session through Slack and agreed on two
                          ideas we could present. We also came to the idea of naming our product the HXT - which stands for
                          <B>H</B>axoft e<B>X</B>traction <B>T</B>ool.
                          <br/>
                          We very roughly sketched our idea and created a paper mockup that resembled the intended functionality.
                          During a meeting in the past, somewhere at the end of November, we have already presented a short
                          paper drawing but it was quite small and contained very little information. This was an upgraded
                          version and contained a couple of new ideas. The Prof. seemed to be quite satisfied with our ideas,
                          but he also expressed his discontent regarding the fact that our mockup was not detailed enough.
                          We agreed and committed to delivering a more sophisticated prototype for our next consultation. It should
                          be at least a clickable electronic prototype, as we understood.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          During the meeting we also received additional information regarding the final report we have to deliver
                          by the end of the semester. As we understood, three parts are crucial and should be contained in it:
                          the weekly work log, a business plan and a description of our product. While the first two were
                          clear in terms of content and form, the third was quite a mystery. None of us have ever
                          dealt with a business plan. We divided the single tasks into two groups: Frank and Luis committed to working
                          on the clickable prototype and Valentin promised to focus on conducting some research regarding the business plan.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Apart from the meeting, we were also able to arrange two more stakeholder interviews. Unfortunately, not all of us
                          were able to attend all of them, but we always managed to have at least two team members present during a single interview.
                          Before the interviews, we agreed to slightly modify our interview questions, because the type of information we needed
                          changed with the advance we made in the project. We conducted the two interview sessions with project planners from
                          Telekom. The amount of new information we gained was not as big as that which we used to collect in our early interviews,
                          but every interview brings some new and interesting information which could be very useful in the future.
                          We shared with them our idea of building the HXT tool and the problem it should solve, but they did not seem to be
                          very excited. We expected this kind of reaction, given the fact that these guys do not write many project proposals.
                          At this point in time, we know that our main potential customers will be among members of research groups.
                          Therefore, we did not take their reaction as a negative outcome, but rather as a confirmation of our assumptions.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          During the Christmas vacations, apart from the typical family visits and new years celebration, we managed to build
                          our first clickable prototype. We also gained a deeper insight into how business plans are written.
                          We are now ready to show the Prof. a nice and shiny, interactive digital prototype!

                          This planspiel week was rather calm and it unfortunately, did not bring too much new progress. We did not even have
                          a customer meeting with the Prof. That would probably have energized our enthusiasm.
                          <br/>
                          Even without it, however, we continued with the collection of information from our potential customers. Arranging
                          the interviews during this week turned out to be quite difficult. Many people rejected our interview requests
                          due to pre-christmas stress. Some seemed to be not really interested in being interviewed, some rejected directly.
                          Nevertheless, we got lucky at least on two occasions and managed to arrange two interviews with two project managers
                          from Telekom. These are scheduled for next week. We look forward to collecting some new useful data!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          During some usual brainstorming session, we experienced for the first time a dispute inside our team. We, however, managed
                          to cool the things down and to continue with our work. We also came to the conclusion, that a team of three
                          is the perfect team size for making decisions. A team of two would often struggle with convincing one another, a team of four
                          could be often in a situation of 2 vs 2. A team of three can always vote and decide for the winning option.
                          Being three guys in a team, we have always managed to somehow solve all the problems we've faced.
                          <br/>
                          We look forward to continuing with our work, and hopefully, the following weeks will bring more progress than this one.

                          It seems that we ended up in the last log entry with a sort of cliffhanger. We did not present our ideas here, did we?
                          Well, the reason is that we have not yet a clear idea of the product we will build. Not yet. Some hints keep rising
                          from our discussions, but before making them public, we prefer to elaborate them more.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regarding what happened this week, we attended the Wednesday planspiel meeting. The presence was mandatory, the
                          interview sessions and an alignment map representing each of the interviews. We also presented a couple of
                          paper prototypes that showed the ideas that could turn into our final product. Some ideas were rather rough and some
                          were more detailed. We presented four or five screens that showed some sketched user interfaces. One of our ideas -
                          a tool for building proposals out of building blocks of text - was the most promising. This one, however, was thrown down
                          by the Prof. because during our presentation he realized that a similar tool already exists. As he informed us, the
                          company building the tool has not been very successful with its product. He, therefore, recommended us to abandon the idea or
                          to do research about the reason behind their lack of success. He also said that it could be theoretically possible, that
                          we could somehow manage to build a better product than the mentioned company. This could be however quite tricky.
                          <br/>
                          This information helped us to realize, that we have not done enough research in the area. Apart from collecting information
                          that would bring us a relevant problem to solve and to solve it in a way that would be helpful for stakeholders,
                          we had to also collect information regarding already existing solutions.
                          In the feedback the Prof. gave us, he also mentioned that he was not quite satisfied with the number of interviews
                          we have conducted. Four people seemed to be a reasonable amount for us, but apparently not for him. Besides, preparing
                          an interview and communicating with the project managers an exact date and time was by no means an easy task. Nevertheless,
                          the Prof. demanded that we conduct at least ten interviews.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Having in front of us the preparation of the next six interviews, we continued with our work. We elaborated a more detailed
                          interview questionnaire and introduced some question categories. We also reviewed the list of our potential products. Some of
                          the ideas we had have been discarded by the presentation during the planspiel. Some of the ideas are simply to big and would demand
                          too much effort and time, which we won't be able to have. The project has to be small enough for us to be able to build a minimum
                          viable product (MVP) by the end of the semester. It also has to be not too small, because it might not be sufficient to solve a
                          meaningful problem.

                      <p>
                          We are not having any planspiel meetings until the 30th of November, due to some conferences that Prof. Gaedke
                          will attend. During the last two weeks, we have been focusing on one task - interviewing stakeholders.
                          We contacted a couple of project managers that some of us have in their personal contact list and tried to schedule
                          an appointment. When an appointment is not possible due to the long distance, we will manage to conduct the interview
                          through a remote communication tool like skype, gotomeeting or some the other available application. We also asked
                          the project managers if they knew some other people that could help us with some information related to project planning.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          By the end of the week, we managed to conduct four interviews. Two project managers from Deutsche Telekom and two guys from
                          the VSR professorship. The phd students from VSR provided us information regarding writing project proposals in the context of
                          getting funding for research projects. This includes delivering project proposals to institutions like the European Commission(EC)
                          or the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft(DFG).
                          <br/>
                          The guys from Telekom provided us with information more related to
                          projects for internal purposes. As we discovered, some managers still apply the waterfall model while planning their projects,
                          some use the more modern Agile approach. Some of their teams are mixed, some are scrum teams without strict roles. Some teams
                          apply Kanban in the process. All the agile teams are doing less planning, due to the agile nature of their process. We also learned
                          that Telekom uses common products like powerpoint, word or a set of internal products to support their project planners.
                          <br/>
                          We think that four interviews deliver a reasonable amount of useful information.
                          We now have a rough understanding of the process of planning a project and we can start thinking about
                          the problem we could solve with our tool. By now, we have come up with eight different ideas for our final
                          product. It is a high number, but some of them are quite big and would probably demand too much effort and time. At least
                          for a small group of student developers.

                    <div class="span8 info-block" align=justify>
                        <p> Finally! We finally got the assignment for our project. We now know what is the problem we should
                            solve. It is, however, a bit disappointing that there are going to be no industrial partners involved
                            as it would be a big boost to our motivation. It seems that there are no companies willing to work with
                            students in projects that would benefit them both. It is, however, understandable from the point of view
                            of a private company. The cooperation with a team of students will probably take a significant amount of time
                            and bring uncertain results in return.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Despite the lack of industrial presence, however, we still can deliver a solution that matters. Nobody is willing
                            to come to us and present the issues they face but we plan to go out and interview potential customers. But who is
                            our potential customer? The Prof. made it more easy for us by limiting our range of choice. We must deliver a
                            solution that supports people dealing with the process of project planning. We think that it would be more
                            motivating and that we could have more enthusiasm if we were allowed to chose our own topic. But well, having
                            a predefined topic probably made things easier.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            In order to start with the interviews, we need to prepare a set of questions. For this purpose, we assembled a
                            brainstorming session and wrote down our first stakeholder questionnaire. At the beginning, we ask the interviewee
                            a set of questions regarding his personal experience and his current position. We think that this information could
                            help us to classify the interviews and to decide which information is more relevant if we found that we
                            received two contradictory answers. As a secondary side effect, it might be a good
                            beginning that could help to diminish the tension that is always present in such interviews.
                            After the initial session, we ask the interviewee what are the processes he/she applies when planning a project
                            and whether he/she applies some standardized approach like the LFA. If they follow no standardized plan,
                            then we ask about the process they currently apply including the description of the single tasks like: what are the
                            inputs/outputs of each phase, what tools are used, what are the requirements to determine that a phase has
                            been finished, etc.
                            <br/>
                            The following interview section deals with the usage of tools. We want to ask what are the tools they use and what
                            are the pain points they experience when using these tools. We will try to collect information to discover the
                            phases that are poorly, or not supported at all by software tools.
                            <br/>
                            At the end of the interview, we ask our interviewee to grade each phase and tool with a number from 1 to 5.
                            This should help us to uncover the most painful spots of project planners, even if not mentioned directly.

                        <p>Unfortunately and against our expectations, this weeks planspiel session didn't bring much new
                            information regarding the problem assignments. We left the session slightly disappointed
                            and with a feeling that we keep standing on the same spot, and not moving forward with the project.
                            The LFA tool was once more introduced by Prof. Gaedke, and since each one of us
                            had already read the sources, we took it as a revision of our knowledge. In the previous session,
                            all the teams were instructed to read the sources about LFA and therefore we felt that
                            the session was a bit wasted.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            However, we did receive one good message from the Prof. - he announced that problem
                            assignments should be presented during the upcoming week, probably on Monday, after the presentations
                            of our current work. The presentations were supposed to contain each team's findings regarding the LFA and the
                            set of sub-tools each team would use to deal with the given assignment. This was the main content of our work
                            during this week. Having a target in front of us, we performed a couple of online brainstorming
                            sessions and finally created a nicely looking presentation containing some examples of the application
                            of LFA on imaginary problems. We also included some analytical diagrams and built a corresponding "log frame".
                            Moreover, we spent some time trying to align the presentation design with the Haxoft
                            "company design".
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On Monday, the announcement of the problem assignments was postponed to Wednesday, which we accepted
                            with a slight disappointment. Despite the bad news, the shifting of the announcement fitted us in the sense
                            that our team was incomplete during this session since one of our team members (Frank) wanted to attend a
                            volunteer engagement in his hometown.
                            <br/>
                            We are looking forward to attending the next planspiel session tomorrow 9th November. We expect to finally
                            receive the problem assignments.

                        <p>In the planspiel session that took place this Wednesday, we presented the core company values
                            we established for Haxoft. Besides that, Prof. Gaedke announced that all the teams have to become familiar
                            with the logical framework approach (LFA). According to his instructions, this should be done before
                            any of the teams get their task assignments. The LFA should provide us with a framework that will guide us during
                            the development of the project and to increase the chances that we eventually deliver a solution that matters.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Until now, we are not sure whether industry partners will be part of the project, or whether
                            our task will be of "internal" nature - as Prof. Gaedke mentioned in some previous sessions.
                            We were informed at the beginning of the planspiel module that it is likely, that an industry
                            partner (a company) will share with us a specific problem they face which could be solved with
                            a software solution. This way, we would be able to work on a solution for a real problem and
                            eventually deliver a software product that matters. However, no project or problem has been
                            assigned to us until now. This is quite confusing however, having in mind the fact that we
                            were asked to think and elaborate our companies mission and vision, without having a
                            connection to a real problem. Some of the issues Prof. Gaedke mentioned he
                            encountered while dealing with some companies, were some concerns regarding the intellectual
                            property laws in Germany.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Despite certain uncertainty with regard to the problem assignment, we started the week with
                            some research about LFA. This in hope the tool could eventually help us when dealing with our future
                            assignment. Each one of us read the sources about LFA provided by the Prof., and we were able
                            to get a solid insight into its main principles and the issues it tackles.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the practical side of our work, we continued to improve some details of the company logo
                            and some minor issues on our company website. At this point, our website matured into a
                            publishable stage. We therefore contacted the computer network administration center of the university
                            and asked for a virtual webserver. This would allow us to publish our website, and to link the domain
                            'haxoft.tu-chemnitz.de' to the IP address of our group's web-space. However, due to university
                            restrictions, this attempt failed. According to the information they provided, we would have
                            to align our website design with the design specified by the TU-Chemnitz and indicate a full-time
                            working university employee who would be responsible for the website content. We were obviously
                            not willing to change our website design, and finding an employee who would be willing to take
                            responsibility for the website content would not be an easy task either. For this reason,
                            we decided to publish the website on a personal user web-space provided by the university.
                            We are currently looking closer into the possibility to rent a URL and link it to this private
                            directory.
                            <br/>
                            As for today, we are looking forward to find out whether we finally get a real problem from a
                            private company. We believe this might happen in the coming weeks.

                        <p>
                        <br>This week had quite a good start due to the positive outcome of the first presentation of our work.
                            In the planspiel meeting this Wednesday, every team was supposed to show what they have achieved.
                            For most of the teams this was obviously not a big amount of work, but nevertheless, we were able to
                            achieve a satisfactory outcome. When comparing with the other teams, we were able to confirm
                            that we have chosen among the best website designs in the class, and a nice looking logo.
                            This was obviously a positive boost to the team's enthusiasm and overall energy.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            After Wednesday meeting, the next step was to come up with the core values of our company.
                            After some online brainstorming sessions and individual thinking about which could be our core values,
                            we met personally on Friday morning to bring our ideas together. Within this meeting, we were able to
                            agree on 8 core values for Haxoft. After writing them down, we noticed that listing them somewhere might
                            give a higher importance to some values while providing less to others. However, we agreed that
                            our core values should all be equally important. For this reason, we decided to arrange the values
                            into a circle, which you can currently see on the main page of the Haxoft website. Under the circle of values,
                            we display the description of the core value that has been selected by the website visitor.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Our team discussions during this week have been growing in size, as the tasks given by our prof. pile up.
                            The communication client Whatsapp seems not to be sufficient anymore, given the fact that all
                            conversations are in one big heap and finding important information about what has been discussed,
                            agreed upon, or rejected is very hard to find as time goes by. Then one of us remembered a tool
                            that was suggested by prof. Gaedke - "Slack". This neat team messaging tool allows you and your
                            teammates to communicate over the internet in a topic-based manner, among other nice features.
                            This turned out to be a good decision. We can already say that Slack has significantly contributed
                            to the improvement of our internal communication.

                            As we promised last week, we have improved our company logo design. It now has a different shade of
                            red which is more in harmony with our website design, and we also removed some other minor flaws.

                            We are starting our project for module "Planspiel Web Engineering", which will be further called
                            'planspiel' along this log.We created our team in the first planspiel session and mutually exchanged
                            our WhatsApp numbers.Our first task is to come up with a name and a logo for our newly created
                            team - which is easier said than done. After many discussions and brainstorming sessions, we have
                            finally found common ground and decided for one name.
                            As you probably know now, we have decided to name our team and company - 'Haxoft'. But why Haxoft? <br/>
                            Haxoft is a composition of two words - hack and soft. While the reason for choosing soft is probably obvious,
                            the reason why we use 'hack' might not be so. The word „hack“ is used in many contexts nowadays,
                            but originally it means „to produce an ingenious piece of work that solves a meaningful problem“.
                            And that’s what we stand for: game-changing and reliable software that will give you an advantage over
                            your competitors. Curiously enough, the name "Haxoft" was one of the first names that came to our mind.
                            One might, therefore, say we are using a rather spontaneous company name. To give you an example
                            of some of the names that we were considering, we provide you below a brief list with some of them: <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hexoft</li>
                                <li>Coconut Technologies</li>
                                <li>BinaryCase</li>
                                <li>BinaryFactory</li>
                                <li>nerdsco</li>
                                <li>Physalis Systems</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            As you can see, we had a few ideas for the company name and each of them had its own story
                            or "reason" behind it. As mentioned before, the better "ground story" and the most consensual
                            turned out to be Haxoft. <br/>
                            Apart from the tasks of coming up with a name and a logo, we were also asked to build a company
                            web site. Given the fact that there are no web-designers in our team, we decided to lookup a bootstrap
                            template that would have an appropriate "look and feel" to fit our new company name.
                            It didn't took us long and we decided to use the neat template 'BRUSHED' from an italian web-designer Alessio Atzeni.
                            While Luis and Frank filled into the template some initial company content, Valentin was dealing
                            with the design of the Haxoft logo. With the help of inkscape and a couple of youtube tutorials
                            he was able to create an x-cube logo as the visual representation of our company. The first version
                            came to life and it surely had its flaws, but we all agreed those would be removed during the next week.<br/>
                            Besides the Homepage, Frank also created a facebook and a twitter page. This way we aim to have more than one customer chanel.
                            At the end of the week, we created a Trello project and started to use this handy tool to manage our tasks.
