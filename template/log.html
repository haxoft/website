                          What a start of a week! We expected to meet the Prof. this week.
                          As he said last week, we will meet probably on Tuesday, we did not even thought about a meeting before Tuesday.
                          But it came differently... <br/>
                          Differently than expected? A challenge to proof our strength our ability of adjusting to different and unexpected circumstances!
                          So what happend actually? At monday we received around 11 am. that we have the chance to meet the professor this day at the late afternoon.
                          Moreover he called it a window of opportunity (WOO) and explained that the meeting will be the meeting how we want to be it.
                          Every team will get 15 minutes and can decide on its own, what will be important at the meeting.
                          As the teams should organize the schedule them selves, we called as the other two teams before, what our timeslot will be.
                          So it was not really an organizing between the teams, but a first come first serve schedule for the appointments. <br/>
                          However, we had to deal with the unexpected meeting a day before and of course we planed initially to solve some work tasks
                          later on monday afternoon or evening. So we had to improvise a bit.
                          As our UI was currently not working as well as we want it to show anyone, we decided to stay away from it and focused on the
                          progress we made the last weeks. And as you read the last entries of our log, yes the UI was not so deep in our focus.
                          To get some ideas about the pitch at the end of the planspiel, we also asked the professor some questions accordingly.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As the week proceeded, we were continuing working on our different purposes we had also last week.
                          Writing our businessplan was the logical next step after our first thoughts last week.
                          With our work on our 10/10/10 business plan, our CANVAS model, our specified core values and the SWOT analysis of ourselves we already did some work
                          relating the businessplan. And even if the CANVAS is somehow the summary of the business plan there are still many gaps for a full business plan.
                          Thus we started to write our business plan and alter the gaps to worked-out details.
                          Until now we are finished with around the half of the plan and have now really a quite detailed market entry strategy. Wow!
                          We did not even expect to have one at the beginning of the planspiel. Maybe also because we did not thought we will need one, but still it is a new experience for us
                          to go in such a detail of economy stuff. Obviously, some ideas were covered in some lectures at university or even in some classes at school, but noone of us actually
                          used them before in practice. Ok, the planspiel is still not that real as we are somehow still studying, but it is needless to say that we can still call it to be very
                          practically oriented - at least for a student.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          We also kept going on in our core feature of extracting knowledge with IR queries.
                          On the one side we need to include it our progress to our HXT and on the other side we need to go on with developing extractions for even more requirements.
                          <a><br/>HEY maybe Frank can write something here about his work?</a>
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          For the next week we plan to finish finally the businessplan and to go on even further with our core feature of the HXT.
                          Moreover we should keep in mind that the pitch is coming closer and closer and that means, we should start also to catch some bullet points for our solution description
                          in our final report for the planspiel.

                          Another week has passed and against expectations, we were not able to meet our customer.
                          Originally, we expected to see Prof. Gaedke on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he did not have time for a meeting.
                          It is quite hard to make significant progress in a project without showing it to somebody who is not directly involved in it. We
                          have been missing a more frequent input from an "external viewer" along the development.
                          As we also experienced, it is motivating to know that the customer is interested in our product and being able to
                          discuss some details with him is crucial to keep the right direction during development.
                          Having that in mind, weekly meetings would be a nice thing to have.
                          This way, we would be able to have more frequent feedback on how we performed/are performing and the adjustments we should make.
                          We are however still doing our best to deal with the current conditions and situation. After all, adjusting to
                          unexpected situations is a key skill of any development team.
                          It is worth mentioning that we very much appreciate the possibility to be consulting issues regarding our emerging product
                          with our Prof., as his planspiel role is twofold: our counselor and the first customer at the same time.
                          <br/>
                          After the original Wednesday meeting, which did not take place, we received information from the Prof. that the next
                          customer meeting should be on Tuesday next week. We are looking forward to it!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regardless of whether the meeting took place or not, we continued with the development of the HXT and the corresponding tasks.
                          Having in mind the fact that the planspiel is coming to its end, we started to sketch out our business plan.
                          Our business model served as a good foundation for this purpose. Within this week, we made some notes about different
                          thoughts we collected and drafted the concrete sections. In order to have the first draft of our business plan, we will have to
                          do some more research and continue with the task during the next week.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          As we already mentioned, the development of the project still continues. We managed to add user management
                          to the backend and the frontend of the application, as well as the corresponding session management. This functionality
                          allows the HXT to recognize different users (with different access rights) and to serve resources to these users accordingly.
                          One part of this functionality that was especially time-consuming was the authentication of users (user agents) making requests
                          to the HXT plugin. The user management is handled at the "front-line" by <a target="_blank" href="https://de.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>
                          and our plugin just simply receives a "claim" containing the information about the user making the request. This kind of delegated
                          authentication was a bit confusing at the beginning since it comprises 3 entities (Atlassian, HXT, User agent)
                          sending and receiving a <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>.
                          <br/>
                          To close this entry with some good news, we are happy to announce that we are now very close to the first
                          automated extraction of some important proposal requirements! We have found the first two optimized
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">IR queries</a> for extraction of our
                          first two requirements (which are both very big and ugly creatures) and we are currently trying to insert them in the
                          extraction module of the HXT plugin.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          So we finally did it! Our weekly log is now fully complete until this point and everybody is free to read it on our website and follow
                          us during the development. We also introduced some hyperlinks for an improved reader experience, especially for those without
                          deeper technical knowledge. From now on, we have committed to deliver new entries as new weeks come. This way, we should be able to
                          describe in more detail what we exactly achieved and what lies in front of us - always from the perspective of the current point in time.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Regarding the events that occurred this week, we were again not able to meet with Prof. Gaedke. Nevertheless, we met each other in order
                          to coordinate the following steps, as we do every week. Within this meeting, we agreed on some details regarding the core component that
                          provides the information extraction functionality for the HXT plugin.
                          <br/>
                          Another high priority requirement to implement is the user and session management. This functionality forms the basis for allowing
                          project sharing among users. Project sharing is among some of the features we intended to support, but we are not confident we will
                          be able to finish it before the final pitch/presentation day. Nevertheless, the system should be ready for such an extension.
                          The current state of the plugin does not support any user management and only recognizes a single user, which should be changed as soon
                          as possible. In order to support user management, we will have to connect the plugin backend with the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/concepts/authentication.html">
                              Atlassian authentication</a>
                          flow and user management system.
                          This trilateral process (user, HXT, Atlassian) will maybe take some effort and time, but we are confident that we will figure it out.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          After finishing all the entries of this log (which takes a significant amount of time), we continued to improve out our
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">CANVAS model</a>.
                          The first version of our CANVAS was consulted with Prof. Gaedke two weeks ago at our customer meeting. To summarize the outcome
                          we can say that he was not particularly happy with the fact that we did not present any meaningful financial entries
                          in our "costs section". We did not leave the entire section out, but the entries were not carefully thought out and they
                          lacked some detailed reasoning - an economist would say that our numbers "were not adding up". In order to fix this, we set up
                          a team meeting and performed some brainstorming on the different reasons and sources of different financial entries.
                          At the end, we were able to finish the CANVAS. This time with some more realistic numbers inside it. This version might potentially
                          serve as a basis for the communication with investors since it shows the basic reasoning behind our economic viability - how much
                          money we want to earn, how we want to earn it, the basic costs of running our company and some other economic details.

                          Without having a customer meeting this week, we simply continued with our work. We did some collective
                          remembering of our work contributions and added some content to this log. The task of maintaining a weekly
                          log is quite tedious and time-consuming, especially when we have to do it retrospectively. We have been
                          obviously writing some notes regarding our continuous progress in the project, but having to formulate our
                          thoughts and putting them in a coherent story line is a surprisingly strenuous activity (especially for developers).
                          <br/>
                          We suspect that writing our entry logs right at the end of each week would make this task somehow easier. However,
                          due to different circumstances, we have been failing to do so until now. On the other hand, we have been successful in
                          writing down at least some notes about our progress within the last weeks - especially after customer meetings with the Prof.
                          We have been trying to catch-up the weekly log debt that has been piling up, and we hope to balance the situation next week, when
                          we hopefully finish all the entries.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          The team meeting this week delivered some promising results. As a result of our brainstorming, we were able to come with
                          some very promising ideas for the core module of the HXT - the module responsible for the requirements extraction. After
                          some research and discussions we have come up with two different approaches of how to deal with the core functionality - one
                          uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">Information Retrieval</a> and the other
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction">Information Extraction</a>.
                          Despite their similar names, the two approaches are
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Information-Extraction-and-Information-Retrieval">
                              quite different</a>.
                          One is more related to Natural Language Processing, and the other is rather based on full-text indexing.
                          In the following weeks, we should elaborate a "proof of concept" example for each of them and after that, we will
                          be able to decide for the most promising in terms of time consumption vs effectiveness.
                          <br/>
                          As already mentioned, the second approach is based on Information Extraction(IE) and potentially more
                          complex and time-consuming. In an ideal world, we would have more time (at least more than 3 months) for the implementation
                          and we would be able to use both approaches in the HXT. The reality, however, is that we have to deliver a running
                          MVP at the middle of March, which is quite restrictive in terms of time possibilities.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Apart from researching about different approaches to solve our main problem, we also looked around for some python libraries which
                          would help us with the task. Moreover, we collected and agreed upon some of the most relevant requirements that the HXT
                          plugin should be able to extract. It is a long list and we are not sure that we can deliver them all before the final pitch day, but
                          we will definitely try hard.
                          <br/>
                          We were aware of the fact that in case we decide ourselves for the IR approach, we will have to build several queries that
                          would match each type of requirement. For this reason, we started to sketch such queries - mainly for the most common and simple
                          requirements. It is worth mentioning that our list of the top-priority requirements to extract was previously consulted with
                          one of our early "potential customer"/stakeholder/interviewee - a member of the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/about/people/">VSR team</a>. We arranged a brief consultation
                          in order to find out whether our list was accurate, and did not contain unnecessary / irrelevant requirements.

                          This week's meeting with Prof. Gaedke did not deliver an entirely satisfactory outcome. We met him
                          on Monday, as in the previous weeks, and he was not too happy with the results we presented.
                          The reason for his dissatisfaction was the amount of work we presented to him. We worked last week on
                          the backend and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">
                          REST API </a>, which is not an easily presentable functionality. For this reason, we did
                          not have a click-able/dynamic/shiny demo to show. As we understood him, we should be always able
                          to deliver an increment - a working demonstration - of whatever we have built. This is not always possible
                          in our opinion, but we did get the message.
                          <br/>
                          If we knew in advance, that delivering a working "something" is a top priority, we are pretty confident we would
                          be able to come up with something to show. After all, our UI is relatively ahead in terms of its development degree,
                          so with a bit more of effort, we would be able to connect the working backend with the UI - at least partially.
                          The lesson we learned this week is quite clear - no more meetings without working increments!
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Apart from the backend, we worked on the research side, our homepage and of course the CANVAS. This week,
                          we need to focus more on the magic part. Until now, the only team member doing research about our
                          magical (core) functionality has been Valentin. This should, however, change as soon as possible
                          since we agreed that the core functionality is far too important and it should not be just handled by a single
                          team member. For this reason, Frank and Luis also started this week with reading some papers about the
                          topic. Hopefully, as we proceed with the research and more of us get familiar with the topic, we will be
                          able to come up with more ideas and to deliver better results.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          In order to have a product increment for the next meeting (hopefully some day next week), we will continue with
                          the connection of the backend with the UI. We are confident what most of the work could be finished
                          by next Monday. We also started to write some <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">
                          unit tests</a> for the backend. We are currently testing only
                          a subset of the backend functionality, but that will change as we go further with the project. The amount
                          of code on the server has been increasing significantly, and we feel that it is the right time for
                          some testing.
                          <br/>
                          The entries in this log are newly available through the "see what's going on" button - as you probably noticed since
                          you are reading this log already. Enjoy!

                          During the customer meeting on Monday, we summarized and presented our work from the previous week. We also briefed him
                          about our plans for further development, and the amount of work we should deliver in the upcoming sessions. We did not
                          finish the meeting in a fully satisfactory way however. We presented him some amount of work, but we also felt that it was not
                          much and this was also the reason why the meeting was so short.
                          <br/>
                          The Prof. did not provide us with much feedback, but he did have a requirement. Until now, we have been
                          informing him about our results only verbally and without any written reports. This should however change, given
                          that he required that we start writing a "work log". This way, we would be able to continuously inform our (potential) customers
                          about the latest news regarding the product development. He also mentioned that it would be nice to inform more our
                          customers about the product itself. Moreover, he suggested we provide a description of our product in our website.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          We did as he asked, and updated our website with the information about our product.
                          We introduced a first version of our product description and added two
                          buttons: one redirecting to our product click-able prototype, and the other redirecting to our work log. We held
                          a brainstorming session in order to elaborate and polish the sentences about the product. After all, a catchy sentence
                          is the first thing a potential customer should see, when he enters our website.
                          <br/>
                          Besides the changes in our website, we also worked on the system's backend. We first designed the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">entity relationship (ER)</a>
                          model that describes the entities in the system. After some brainstorming sessions, we were able to
                          accept the first working version and we created a digital diagram for documentation purposes. After that, we implemented
                          the ER model in Django, by writing the code that defines the backend persistence models.
                          <br/>
                          We also managed to achieve some progress on our research regarding
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>.
                          We now know, that our problem can be solved by using at least two approaches. The first is Information Retrieval (IR) which
                          is mainly used for searching information inside documents. To put it simple, every search engine uses IR for processing a search
                          request.
                          <br/>
                          The second approach is Information Extraction(IE). This approach is more about extracting knowledge from text. It uses
                          classifiers, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and other fancy methods belonging to AI.
                          Both methods could be very useful in our future efforts to solve the problem of requirements extraction.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          The last issue we dealt with, was our first CANVAS model. We did it by using a set of tools available at
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/">leanstack.com</a>. The tool helped us to
                          materialize and shape the ideas we already had in our minds, but which were until now quite abstract.
                          The more ideas we could find, the better. For this reason, we agreed on that each one of us would
                          create his own canvas model and then presented it to the rest of the team. When finished, we merged
                          our ideas and created the final digital CANVAS model.

                          This weeks customer meeting was quite extensive! The consultation with Prof. Gaedke lasted about an hour.
                          Apparently, there were many things we had to discuss. We presented him the first version of our clickable
                          prototype, the first version of our business plan and the results of our research regarding
                          calls for proposals.
                          <br/>
                          We shared with him our idea of building a desktop application and showed him our clickable prototype.
                          He did not like very much the idea of building a "thick" desktop
                          client. We were told that students of a Web Engineering program should be building web applications, not
                          desktop apps. We have been obviously discussing inside the team, the different types of applications we could
                          build, but none of us saw enough arguments for building a web app. The professor, however, seemed to have many
                          arguments about why we should build a web application instead. We must say most of them were quite convincing. Among
                          some of the arguments he shared with us was that distributing a desktop app is more difficult than simply
                          creating an account in a web app, or adding a plugin to an existing platform like "Wordpress" or "Atlassian".
                          Another argument was the functionality of shared projects. It is much easier to share projects in a web app than
                          a desktop client.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          One very good point the Prof. made, was his suggestion about creating an application as a part of an already existing,
                          well-established ecosystem. A plugin or extension that could leverage the success of a third party product, by using
                          its existing plugin distribution system such as the Atlassian marketplace, Microsoft Windows Store app, Google play or
                          similar application distribution centers. This was a very good idea which we readily adopted.
                          <br/>
                          We left from this meeting convinced that it would really be a better choice to build a web application. We will
                          have to slightly change the prototype design, but not entirely. The structure will remain the same, but some
                          components will have to be replaced in order to achieve a better "web" feeling.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Somewhere in the middle of the meeting, the Prof. asked us, if our business "scale". We did not know what he meant, nor
                          what to answer. We understood the importance of the question after he explained what he exactly meant. Put simply, a business
                          scales, if it can growth revenue with minimal or no increase in operating costs. This question was tightly bound to his
                          suggestion about exploiting an existing ecosystem. We could increase our growth without increasing the costs required for marketing.
                          Having learned something new and interesting, we continued with the interview.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To summarize our progress over the week, we can state that we conducted some research and held a couple of brainstorming
                          sessions about the possible platforms we could use to build our application. After that, we concluded that
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://de.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> is the best option. We chose this platform for its
                          prevalence among research groups as well as its appealing plugin architecture. The architecture is surprisingly
                          flexible. The plugin (add-on in the Atlassian terminology) is a common web application that serves HTML
                          content over the internet to the Atlassian product. The served content is then inserted in an Atlassian "IFrame" and
                          served to the user as if it was content from Atlassian. This provides a seamless integration of the add-on and the
                          Atlassian product, and at the same time provides an extreme level of flexibility.
                          <br/>
                          Another advantage of building the add-on as a web application is that we could very easily extend the system
                          in order to publish a standalone version of it. The UI might remain unchanged, as well as the backend. The only
                          modification we would have to make would be regarding the authentication of users. We would have to provide our own
                          user management since the add-on uses delegated auth provided by Atlassian. This, however, is not at all difficult nor costly.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          During the meeting, we also showed the Prof. a SWOT Analysis we created with the help of a tool available at
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cayenneapps.com/swot-analysis">cayenneapps.com</a>. While doing the analysis,
                          we gained an interesting insight into our emerging company. The analysis forced us to think about our current
                          situation from an external point of view.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          After the meeting, we managed to develop the first version of the user interface. We also created
                          the skeleton of our Django server and configured a Postgres database. We also managed to do
                          two more interviews with the
                          <a target="_blank" href="https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/about/people/">VSRians</a>
                          and started with our research about NLP. This topic seems to be more extensive than we initially thought.

                          Even if there was again no meeting with Prof. Gaedke this week, we started to go on with our great idea of the HXT.
                          Therefore we built our electronic prototype of HXT out of our paper prototype, which you can
                          <a target="_blank" href="HaxoftExtractionTool.pdf">check out</a> at your own at our website.
                          Furthermore we interviewed a Professor of our University at Wednesday.
                          At first he was not really proud of our idea and suggested that nobody will need something like plan.
                          So were really disappointed. Is there maybe noone who would buy our stuff?
                          But by going on with the interview and rather the description of our tool it tourned out that the idea is not such bad.
                          For quite the opposite the tool could really help everyone who deals with the situation to write a proposal as we thought.
                          So the first rejection was only based on not knowing the core of our idea.
                          Thus our mood rised to a high level of happiness at the end of the interview, cause once more our idea met interest.
                          Moreover we also shall write him a mail, when we pitching our idea at the end of the semester.
                          This gave us also a big charge of motivation.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          To get even more results from potential customers we created a google form as a replacement of the direct interviews.
                          Such a form can be spread via social media to all potential customers and make it possible for them to give us more information
                          without further time management of our side.
                          Hence we can get in touch with even more potential customers and their ideas and problems in the dimension of writing proposals.
                          Therefore we discussed this week a bit, how we should spread our form in detail.
                          Our first assumption is now that we will spread it via LinkedIn and E-Mail.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          In addition we made this week some research about the source of requirements - the calls for proposals.
                          So we all read finally some calls and started to get a knowledge what the given structure is all about.
                          Thereby we recognized that the European Commission is the most structured founding agency in relation to the calls.
                          I.e. the DFG is much more untidier in the structure of their calls than the EC.
                          To start anywhere we also decided to concentrate our MVP on the calls from the EC.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Last but not least, we sat together and built our first short business plan.
                          It is based on the 10/10/10 business plan idea from Alex Glassey at
                          <a target="_blank" href="http://alexglassey.com/2016/12/business-planning-season-ugh/">AlexGlassey.com</a>.
                          This process showed us, that there are still many questions opened related to our business model, but we also
                          experienced again a high team connectivity within the process.
                          There were several discussions about formulating it corretly for everyone of us, but finally we developed our
                          first bullet listed business plan.

                          The meeting on wednesday the 14th December was the last meeting as a class of teams with the Prof. Gaedke.
                          Incredible that we are already here at the kick-off for the implementation of our ideas.
                          We were once not happy about the long not knowing about what we really do here as a solution. But somehow this meeting was a high step forward.
                          And we recognized, that we did not much the week before.
                          Ok, we also had no clue where we should really go ahead, because we still had several good ideas.
                          And we did not really made a decision on what idea we want to focus.
                          But then suddenly we had to.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Because the Professor wanted to meet us two days after the wednesday meeting. And he wants to meet each team separately.
                          Within this meeting, we should present him our idea for the planspiel - or rather our product.
                          So we had again several discussion via slack, which idea we should choose.
                          In the end, we came to our <B>H</B>axoft e<B>X</B>traction <B>T</B>ool (HXT).
                          Which was at the start of the meeting at Friday the 16th very briefly prototyped.
                          We already had many ideas, how we want to evolve and develop HXT, but we had not really sketched them into a prototype or a demo mockup.
                          In our first presentation of our ideas at the end of November, we already had a shortly drawn paper prototype for HXT, but it was one of the small ones.
                          So Prof. Gaedke was quite satisfied and contented about our idea, but also deplored that we only had on ruff sketch of our idea.
                          Hence the task for the holiday season was clear. We need really a good prototype.
                          And not only a paper prototype in the end, we want to have a clickable prototype of our idea.
                          Moreover now know, what we have to include in our report at the end of the semester.
                          Three parts are therefore important. At first our team log. Well that is what you actually read here.
                          A log or maybe diary about us as a team and how we experienced the whole planspiel.
                          As a second part we should provide a business plan and finally we also should of course have a description part about our product.
                          While the first and the last part was very clear to us all, we all have not much experience on writing a business plan.
                          Therefore we splat our high priority tasks to different people. Frank and Luis focused thereby on the prototype and Valentin focused on the business plan research.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Furthermore we also had as mentioned before two more interviews.
                          Unfortunately not all of us could come to each interview, but at every interview were at least two of us.
                          Spontaneously we also changed a bit our interview plan. Because we did not need anymore those deep details on what they are doing at project planning.
                          Additionally those topics were for us pretty clear through our first two interviews with guys from the telekom.
                          Because one company is not doing it totally different that much.
                          Of course we asked them shortly about their phases of planning, but they told us the same keywords as the other ones, hence it was as we thought.
                          What we did instead was asking them, if they would be interested in our idea - the HXT.
                          The response was not that positive, but we knew also before, that those guys do not write proposals that much.
                          Or not with such high strict requirements.
                          So it was not bad news, but confirmation of our assumptions.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          While we had our typical visits at our family by christmas and celebrated somehow the new year, we took as much time as possible to build our paper prototype
                          and get more knowledge on writing a business plan.
                          Within the end of the year we also had a paper prototype, we all agreed on.

                      <p>
                          With again no meeting in the week, this week does not happend that much new.
                          We of course continued to get some interviews, but the holiday season was therefore not a good friend.
                          Many people rejected us, due to pre christmas stress.
                          Actually they maybe are not interested to get interviewed by us at all, but that was mostly what they said.
                          But we had also success regarding two more interviewees from telekom for the end of the week and the beginning of next week.
                          Unfortunately we had also a little dispute about our preferred idea.
                          The good thing here is that whenever we have a little dispute, mostly everyone of us is interested in solving it
                          and not, as also one of our values demands, blame one of us. Beside of those personalities harming quite good, we also experienced our perfect team size.
                          The good thing about three guys in a team is, that mostly only two guys have much to discuss or rather argue against each other.
                          So one of us can always bring the other two back to a line of agreement by having simply a bit a distance to the discussion.
                          So even if we do not directly agree to each other, we have already our methods to go on as one team.

                      <p>Ok, yes. We somehow ended up in the last log with a sort of cliffhanger. And yes we did not explain to you all the ideas.
                          Well of course we could not, because those are our ideas and unfortunately we want to bring them up to you, if we have a more detailed view.
                          To comeback to our logging, we had to show up at our wednesday meeting of the planspiel.
                          And we had to present, what we did the last weeks. Hence we presented our results from the interviews.
                          So we sketched alignment maps for each of our interviewees, for a better visualization.
                          Moreover we presented our first paper prototypes of our corresponding ideas.
                          Well, we did not present all, but four of them.
                          Two of them a bit more detailed and the other two a bit more ruff. What means that we simply draw one very simple mockup on one piece of paper for the simpler ones.
                          Prof. Gaedke somehow demurred at our more detailed ideas, because he remembers some tools, which already supporting such issues.
                          And those are not really successfully. So we could get of course even better then they are, but we need to have it clearly in mind.
                          From our point of view, it was very interesting, that no one of our interviewees came to the point, that those tools somehow exists or he used them.
                          In the retrospective it is of course clear that by only four interviewees, such things could maybe not get mentioned.
                          But at all, we did not think about that before. So therefore we learned here again, that asking more people is always better.
                          Thus we were maybe a bit to happy about our ideas to be enough impartial.
                          Furthermore Prof. Gaedke claimed that we only interviewed four person. For us it was so much new information, that we did not really think about interviewing more in this period.
                          Besides the fact, that those interviews always need alot of preparing time due to connecting to potential interview partners and stipulating an appointment.
                          But of course interviewing more would be better. So for that Prof. Gaedke told us all, that we need at least ten interviewees.
                          So we started over to get some more interview partners.
                          By doing that we discussed alot about our ideas to form them to a newer, more detailed level of perception.
                          Furthermore we added some ideas and scraped some not good enough ones.
                          So how can we say, they are not good enough?
                          Well if no one of us sees real capability behind it with our current skill level, then it is not good enough stay in our current focus.
                          So for example we had some ideas, which were very cool but we were not sure about the feasibility by us three.
                          Some of them were so big, that we could not come to a point of having a clear idea, how we will perform and build a MVP within this semester.
                          Hence we sorted them out of our list.

                          This entry of our log is the first one going over two weeks. Due to some conferences and some abroad meetings of Prof. Gaedke,
                          there are no meetings until the 30th November. Within this two weeks we managed one big purpose - our interviews.
                          Hence it is not that much difference between the weeks for us, it is also not for our log.
                          So we contacted project planners we know and asked them for an interview and even asked them, if they know more guys, who would probably let us interview them.
                          <br/>
                          With some circumstances we closed the two weeks with somehow 'only' four interviews. But those interviews were all great for getting knowledge about our potential customers.
                          We interviewed so far two guys from Deutsche Telekom, further on only called telekom, and two guys from the university or rather the VSR professorship.
                          The guys from the professorship strongly talked about proposals in the context of project planning, because they need to get money from financing institutions
                          like the European Commission (EC) or the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft (DFG).
                          So they mainly focused on how they could get the money for their ideas within their scope of possibilities, where as the guys from telekom mostly do not have the decision on if they have the money or not.
                          They told us, that mostly only the vice-presidents or rather the senior-vice-presidents of the department decide whether for this idea is money bestowed or not.
                          So the ideas of on what the project is built is very different from project to project.
                          And they have also about 4 different schemes of project management and thereby different plannings.
                          They still perform sometimes a nearby waterfall-model and so a very strict planing phase.
                          The other three different types of project management within specific teams, is a bit more less planed due to agile development.
                          There are scrum teams, some mixed teams, which perform scrum without strictly roles within one team and there is the idea of kanban coming up.
                          All those more agile versions, perform less planing due to the kept opened mind of all involved to non limit the agile increment.
                          Moreover we found out that the telekom uses mostly common products, like powerpoint, or own products to help project planners.
                          This is somehow sometimes also a pain point, but it could be also be really hard to influence such a big company to perform now totally different and buy some
                          supporting software from our company. But of course we also thought about ideas how we could help those guys.
                          In the end we have about eight ideas now. And that makes us all pretty happy.

                        <p>So finally we have our own issue, which we can solve. And build a solution that matters.
                            No. Wait. We do not have such an issue. There are no industrial partners working with us directly
                            in cooperation. So yeah, we are disappointed. Because somehow it would be really cool to work with
                            industrial partners from the very beginning. Unfortunately it seems to be so that no german company
                            wants to work with students and builds thereby a competitor or solution supplier for one of their main tasks.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            BUT we still can deliver a product that matters - or rather a solution that matters.
                            So if no one comes to us and presents us his problems and pain points out of his motivation to solve them,
                            we will help them and go out of the office to interview potential customers. But wait if we do not have
                            a clear idea right now what we want to build, where are our potential customers settled down?
                            Well Prof. Gaedke there somehow limited us, the teams of the current planspiel, to bring in an idea to somehow help guys, who plan projects.
                            With the knowledge of LFA and even more about some other Frameworks like HCD out of the lectures from Prof. Gaedke we have some an idea what is done by those.
                            That this could be only an idea and the reality strictly works differently was directly in our mind,
                            but we faced the challenge to find some the ideas we need to emplace our company to its 'living rights'.
                            Hence Prof. Gaedke somehow brought us a motivation to go on, but thereby strictly limited us to software for project planning.
                            And everyone of us is not that happy to develop a solution in this dimension. But still we will face it and talk to project planners.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            So to successfully hold an interview, you need some questions prepared. Therefore everyone of us brainstormed on his own and took some short notes.
                            After this short phase of orientation, we sat together and merged our ideas to a detailed plan, what we want to ask.
                            As a starting point our plan determines some easy question about our interview partner.
                            So how long she or he worked already as a project planner and what her or his current position is named.
                            With this introduction knowledge we can on one side help the interviewed one to get started in the answering flow with easy to answer questions
                            and on the other side we can later on better compare the different results from the interviews - so somehow classify them a bit.
                            Then we want to ask them which processes the apply to plan a project and if they maybe implemented standard approaches like LFA.
                            If they do not have any standard approach implemented, they should provide us with their follow up plan to come to a project plan.
                            After knowing their processes or may rather phases of creating a plan for a new project, we want to ask them detailed questions on each phase.
                            Like what are the inputs and outputs of the different phase, what they do there usually and based on which requirements they maybe need to finish this phase.
                            Moreover we want to ask them for the tools they use for project planning in each of those phases and if there are pain points anywhere.
                            Those pain points of course do not need to be only in a software, but also in other structural pursuits.
                            And maybe some phases are poorly supported?
                            <br/>
                            Furthermore we want to asked them, why they do the things the way they do it.
                            And maybe there can be different types of proposals and therefore different processes to think about.
                            In the end of the interview we want to them to grade each phase or tool with 1 to 5.
                            This will hopefully also help us to uncover pain points they even do not directly mention.

                        <p>Unfortunately and against our expectations, this weeks planspiel session didn't bring much new
                            information regarding the problem assignments. We left the session slightly disappointed
                            and with a feeling that we keep standing on the same spot, and not moving forward with the project.
                            The LFA tool was once more introduced by Prof. Gaedke, and since each one of us
                            had already read the sources, we took it as a revision of our knowledge. In the previous session,
                            all the teams were instructed to read the sources about LFA and therefore we felt that
                            the session was a bit wasted.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            However, we did receive one good message from the Prof. - he announced that problem
                            assignments should be presented during the upcoming week, probably on Monday, after the presentations
                            of our current work. The presentations were supposed to contain each team's findings regarding the LFA and the
                            set of sub-tools each team would use to deal with the given assignment. This was the main content of our work
                            during this week. Having a target in front of us, we performed a couple of online brainstorming
                            sessions and finally created a nicely looking presentation containing some examples of the application
                            of LFA on imaginary problems. We also included some analytical diagrams and built a corresponding "log frame".
                            Moreover, we spent some time trying to align the presentation design with the Haxoft
                            "company design".
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On Monday, the announcement of the problem assignments was postponed to Wednesday, which we accepted
                            with a slight disappointment. Despite the bad news, the shifting of the announcement fitted us in the sense
                            that our team was incomplete during this session since one of our team members (Frank) wanted to attend a
                            volunteer engagement in his hometown.
                            <br/>
                            We are looking forward to attending the next planspiel session tomorrow 9th November. We expect to finally
                            receive the problem assignments.

                        <p>In the planspiel session that took place this Wednesday, we presented the core company values
                            we established for Haxoft. Besides that, Prof. Gaedke announced that all the teams have to become familiar
                            with the logical framework approach (LFA). According to his instructions, this should be done before
                            any of the teams get their task assignments. The LFA should provide us with a framework that will guide us during
                            the development of the project and to increase the chances that we eventually deliver a solution that matters.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Until now, we are not sure whether industry partners will be part of the project, or whether
                            our task will be of "internal" nature - as Prof. Gaedke mentioned in some previous sessions.
                            We were informed at the beginning of the planspiel module that it is likely, that an industry
                            partner (a company) will share with us a specific problem they face which could be solved with
                            a software solution. This way, we would be able to work on a solution for a real problem and
                            eventually deliver a software product that matters. However, no project or problem has been
                            assigned to us until now. This is quite confusing however, having in mind the fact that we
                            were asked to think and elaborate our companies mission and vision, without having a
                            connection to a real problem. Some of the issues Prof. Gaedke mentioned he
                            encountered while dealing with some companies, were some concerns regarding the intellectual
                            property laws in Germany.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Despite certain uncertainty with regard to the problem assignment, we started the week with
                            some research about LFA. This in hope the tool could eventually help us when dealing with our future
                            assignment. Each one of us read the sources about LFA provided by the Prof., and we were able
                            to get a solid insight into its main principles and the issues it tackles.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the practical side of our work, we continued to improve some details of the company logo
                            and some minor issues on our company website. At this point, our website matured into a
                            publishable stage. We therefore contacted the computer network administration center of the university
                            and asked for a virtual webserver. This would allow us to publish our website, and to link the domain
                            'haxoft.tu-chemnitz.de' to the IP address of our group's web-space. However, due to university
                            restrictions, this attempt failed. According to the information they provided, we would have
                            to align our website design with the design specified by the TU-Chemnitz and indicate a full-time
                            working university employee who would be responsible for the website content. We were obviously
                            not willing to change our website design, and finding an employee who would be willing to take
                            responsibility for the website content would not be an easy task either. For this reason,
                            we decided to publish the website on a personal user web-space provided by the university.
                            We are currently looking closer into the possibility to rent a URL and link it to this private
                            directory.
                            <br/>
                            As for today, we are looking forward to find out whether we finally get a real problem from a
                            private company. We believe this might happen in the coming weeks.

                        <br>This week had quite a good start due to the positive outcome of the first presentation of our work.
                            In the planspiel meeting this Wednesday, every team was supposed to show what they have achieved.
                            For most of the teams this was obviously not a big amount of work, but nevertheless, we were able to
                            achieve a satisfactory outcome. When comparing with the other teams, we were able to confirm
                            that we have chosen among the best website designs in the class, and a nice looking logo.
                            This was obviously a positive boost to the team's enthusiasm and overall energy.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            After Wednesday meeting, the next step was to come up with the core values of our company.
                            After some online brainstorming sessions and individual thinking about which could be our core values,
                            we met personally on Friday morning to bring our ideas together. Within this meeting, we were able to
                            agree on 8 core values for Haxoft. After writing them down, we noticed that listing them somewhere might
                            give a higher importance to some values while providing less to others. However, we agreed that
                            our core values should all be equally important. For this reason, we decided to arrange the values
                            into a circle, which you can currently see on the main page of the Haxoft website. Under the circle of values,
                            we display the description of the core value that has been selected by the website visitor.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Our team discussions during this week have been growing in size, as the tasks given by our prof. pile up.
                            The communication client Whatsapp seems not to be sufficient anymore, given the fact that all
                            conversations are in one big heap and finding important information about what has been discussed,
                            agreed upon, or rejected is very hard to find as time goes by. Then one of us remembered a tool
                            that was suggested by prof. Gaedke - "Slack". This neat team messaging tool allows you and your
                            teammates to communicate over the internet in a topic-based manner, among other nice features.
                            This turned out to be a good decision. We can already say that Slack has significantly contributed
                            to the improvement of our internal communication.
                            <br/>
                            As we promised last week, we have improved our company logo design. It now has a different shade of
                            red which is more in harmony with our website design, and we also removed some other minor flaws.

                            We are starting our project for module "Planspiel Web Engineering", which will be further called
                            'planspiel' along this log.We created our team in the first planspiel session and mutually exchanged
                            our WhatsApp numbers.Our first task is to come up with a name and a logo for our newly created
                            team - which is easier said than done. After many discussions and brainstorming sessions, we have
                            finally found common ground and decided for one name.
                            As you probably know now, we have decided to name our team and company - 'Haxoft'. But why Haxoft? <br/>
                            Haxoft is a composition of two words - hack and soft. While the reason for choosing soft is probably obvious,
                            the reason why we use 'hack' might not be so. The word „hack“ is used in many contexts nowadays,
                            but originally it means „to produce an ingenious piece of work that solves a meaningful problem“.
                            And that’s what we stand for: game-changing and reliable software that will give you an advantage over
                            your competitors. Curiously enough, the name "Haxoft" was one of the first names that came to our mind.
                            One might, therefore, say we are using a rather spontaneous company name. To give you an example
                            of some of the names that we were considering, we provide you below a brief list with some of them: <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hexoft</li>
                                <li>Coconut Technologies</li>
                                <li>BinaryCase</li>
                                <li>BinaryFactory</li>
                                <li>nerdsco</li>
                                <li>Physalis Systems</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            As you can see, we had a few ideas for the company name and each of them had its own story
                            or "reason" behind it. As mentioned before, the better "ground story" and the most consensual
                            turned out to be Haxoft. <br/>
                            Apart from the tasks of coming up with a name and a logo, we were also asked to build a company
                            web site. Given the fact that there are no web-designers in our team, we decided to lookup a bootstrap
                            template that would have an appropriate "look and feel" to fit our new company name.
                            It didn't took us long and we decided to use the neat template 'BRUSHED' from an italian web-designer Alessio Atzeni.
                            While Luis and Frank filled into the template some initial company content, Valentin was dealing
                            with the design of the Haxoft logo. With the help of inkscape and a couple of youtube tutorials
                            he was able to create an x-cube logo as the visual representation of our company. The first version
                            came to life and it surely had its flaws, but we all agreed those would be removed during the next week.<br/>
                            Besides the Homepage, Frank also created a facebook and a twitter page. This way we aim to have more than one customer chanel.
                            At the end of the week, we created a Trello project and started to use this handy tool to manage our tasks.
